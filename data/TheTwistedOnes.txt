"Don’t trust your eyes.” 

Dr. Treadwell walked back and forth across the platform 
at the front of the auditorium. Her steps were slow and 
even, almost hypnotic. 

“Your eyes deceive you every day, filling in the blanks for 
you in a world of sensory overload.” An image of dizzying 
geometric detail lit up the canvas screen behind her. “When 
| say ‘sensory overload’ | mean that quite literally. At every 
moment, your senses are receiving far more information 
than they can process all at once, and your mind is forced to 
choose which signals to pay attention to. It does that based 
on your experiences, and your expectation of what is 
normal. The things we are familiar with are the things we 
can—for the most part—ignore. We see this most easily with 
olfactory fatigue: your nose ceases to perceive a smell when 


you've been around it for a while. You may be quite thankful 
for this phenomenon, depending on the habits of your 
roommate.” 

The class tittered dutifully, then became quiet as the 
image of another multicolored design flashed onto the 
screen. 

The professor gave a hint of a smile and continued. 

“Your mind creates motion when there is none. It fills in 
colors and trajectories based on what you’ve seen before, 
and calculates what you should be seeing now.” Another 
image flashed onto the overhead screen. “If your mind 
didn’t do this, then simply walking outside and seeing a tree 
would consume all your mental energy, leaving no resources 
to do anything else. In order for you to function in the world, 
your mind fills in the spaces of that tree with its own leaves 
and branches.” A hundred pencils scribbled all at once, 
filling the lecture hall with a sound like scurrying mice. 

“It’s why when you enter a house for the first time you 
experience a moment of dizziness. Your mind is taking in 
more than usual. It’s drawing a floor plan, creating a palette 
of colors, and saving an inventory of images to draw on 
later, so you don’t have to go through that exhausting 
intake every single time. The next time you enter that same 
house, you'll already know where you are.” 

“Charlie!” An urgent voice whispered her name, inches 
from her ear. Charlie kept writing. She was staring straight 
ahead at the display at the front of the lecture hall. As Dr. 
Treadwell went on, she paced faster, occasionally flinging an 
arm toward the screen to illustrate her point. Her words 
seemed to be falling behind as her mind raced on ahead; 
Charlie had realized by the second day of classes that her 
professor sometimes broke off in the middle of one 


sentence, only to finish an entirely different one. It was like 
she skimmed the text in her head, reading out a few words 
here and there. Most of the students in her robotics class 
found it maddening, but Charlie liked it. It made the lesson 
kind of like doing a puzzle. 

The screen flashed again, displaying an assortment of 
mechanical parts and a diagram of an eye. “This is what you 
must re-create.” Dr. Treadwell stepped back from the image, 
turning to look at it with the class. “Basic artificial 
intelligence is all about sensory control. You won’t be 
dealing with a mind that can filter these things out for itself. 
You must design programs that recognize basic shapes, 
while discarding unimportant information. You must do for 
your robot what your own mind does for you: create a 
simplified and organized assembly of information based on 
what’s relevant. Let’s start by looking at some examples of 
basic shape recognition.” 

“Charlie,” hissed the voice again, and she waved her 
pencil impatiently at the figure peering over her shoulder— 
her friend Arty—trying to shoo him away. The gesture cost 
her a moment, put her half a step behind the professor. She 
hurried to catch up, anxious not to miss a single line. 

The paper in front of her was covered in formulas, notes 
in the margins, sketches, and diagrams. She wanted to get 
everything down all at once: not just the math, but all the 
things it made her think of. If she could tie the new facts to 
things she already knew, she’d retain it much more easily. 
She felt hungry for it, alert, watching for new tidbits of 
information like a dog under the dinner table. 

A boy near the front raised his hand to ask a question, 
and Charlie felt a brief flare of impatience. Now the whole 
class would have to stop while Treadwell went back to 


explain a simple concept. Charlie let her mind wander, 
Sketching absently in the margins of her notebook. 

John would be here in—she glanced restlessly at her 
watch—an hour. / told him maybe someday we'll see each 
other again. | guess it’s someday. He had called out of the 
blue: “I’m just going to be passing through,” he said, and 
Charlie hadn’t bothered to ask how he knew where she was. 
Of course he would know. There was no reason not to meet 
him, and she found herself alternately excited and filled with 
dread. Now, as she absently sketched rectangular forms 
along the bottom of her note paper, her stomach jumped, a 
little soasm of nerves. It felt like a lifetime since she last 
saw him. Sometimes, it felt like she’d seen him yesterday, 
as if the last year hadn’t passed. But of course it had, and 
everything had changed for Charlie once again. 

That May, the night of her eighteenth birthday, the 
dreams had begun. Charlie was long accustomed to 
nightmares, the worst moments of her past forced up like 
bile, into twisted versions of memories already too terrible 
to recall. She shoved these dreams into the back of her 
mind in the morning and sealed them away, knowing they 
would only breach it when night fell again. 

These dreams were different. When she woke, she was 
physically exhausted: not just drained but sore, her muscles 
weak. Her hands were stiff and aching, like they’d been 
clenched into fists for hours. These new dreams didn’t come 
every night, but when they did, they interrupted her regular 
nightmares and took them over. It didn’t matter if she was 
running and screaming for her life, or wandering aimlessly 
through a dull mishmash of the various places she’d been 
all week. Suddenly, from nowhere, she would sense him: 
Sammy, her lost twin brother, was near. 


She knew he was present the same way she knew that 
she was present, and whatever the dream was, it dropped 
away—people, places, light, and sound. Now she was 
searching for him in the darkness, calling his name. He 
never answered. She would drop to her hands and knees, 
feeling her way through the dark, letting his presence guide 
her until she came to a barrier. It was smooth and cold, 
metal. She couldn’t see it, but she hit it hard with one fist 
and it echoed. “Sammy?” she would call, hitting harder. She 
stood, reaching up to see if she could scale the slick surface, 
but it stretched up far above her head. She beat her fists 
against the barricade until they hurt. She screamed her 
brother’s name until her throat was raw, until she fell to the 
floor and leaned on the solid metal, pressing her cheek to its 
cool surface and hoping for a whisper from the other side. 
He was there; she knew it as surely as if he were a part of 
herself. 

She knew in those dreams that he was present. Worse, 
when she was awake, she knew he was not there. 

In August, Charlie and Aunt Jen had their first fight. 
They’d always been too distant to really argue. Charlie 
never felt the need to rebel, because Jen provided no real 
authority. And Jen never took anything Charlie did 
personally, never tried to stop her from doing anything, as 
long as she was Safe. The day Charlie moved in with her at 
the age of seven, Aunt Jen had told her plainly that she was 
not a replacement for Charlie’s parents. By now, Charlie was 
old enough to understand that Jen had meant it as a gesture 
of respect, a way to reassure Charlie that her father 
wouldn’t be forgotten, that she would always be his child. 
But at the time it had seemed like an admonishment. Don’t 
expect parenting. Don’t expect love. And so Charlie hadn’t. 


Jen had never failed to care for Charlie. Charlie had never 
wanted for food or clothing, and Jen had taught her to cook, 
to take care of the house, to manage her money, and to fix 
her own car. You have to be independent, Charlie. You have 
to know how to take care of yourself. You have to be 
stronger than—she'd cut herself off, but Charlie knew how 
the sentence ended. Than your father. 

Charlie shook her head, trying to jerk herself free of her 
own thoughts. 

“What's wrong?” Arty said next to her. 

“Nothing,” she whispered. She ran her pencil again and 
again over the same lines: up, over, down, over, the 
graphite wearing thicker and thicker. 

Charlie had told Jen that she was going back to 
Hurricane, and Jen’s face turned stony, her skin paling. 

“Why would you want to do that?” she asked with a 
dangerous calm in her voice. Charlie’s heart beat faster. 
Because that’s where | lost him. Because | need him more 
than | need you. The thought of returning had been nagging 
at her for months, growing stronger with each passing week. 
One morning she awoke and the choice was made, final, 
sitting in her mind with a solid weight. 

“Jessica’s going to college at St. George,” she told her 
aunt. “She’s starting the summer semester so | can stay 
with her while I’m there. | want to see the house again. 
There’s still so much | don’t understand; it just feels ... 
important,” she finished weakly, faltering as Jen’s eyes— 
dark blue, like marble—fixed on her. 

Jen didn’t answer for a long moment then she said 
simply, “No.” 

Why not? Charlie might once have said. You /et me go 
before. But after what happened last year, when she and 


Jessica and the others went back to Freddy’s and discovered 
the horrifying truth behind the murders at her father’s old 
pizzeria, things had changed between them. Charlie had 
changed. Now she met Jen’s gaze, determined. “I’m going,” 
she said, trying to keep her own voice steady. 

Then everything exploded. 

Charlie didn’t know which of them started shouting first, 
but she screamed until her throat was fiery and sore, hurling 
at her aunt every pain she’d ever inflicted, every hurt she 
had failed to prevent. Jen shouted back that she only ever 
meant to care for Charlie, that she had always done her 
best, flinging reassuring words that somehow dripped with 
poison. 

“I’m leaving!” Charlie screamed with finality. She started 
for the door, but Jen grabbed her arm, yanking her violently 
back. Charlie stumbled, almost falling before she caught 
herself on the kitchen table, and Jen let her hand drop with 
a shocked expression. There was silence, and then Charlie 
left. 

She packed a bag, feeling as if she had somehow 
diverged from reality, into an impossible parallel world. 
Then she got in her car and drove away. She didn’t tell 
anyone she was going. Her friends here were not close 
friends; there was no one she owed an explanation. 

When Charlie got to Hurricane, she’d intended to go 
straight to her father’s house, to stay there for the next few 
days until Jessica arrived on campus. But as she reached the 
city limits, something stopped her. / can’t, she thought. / 
can’t ever go back. She turned the car around, drove 
straight to St. George, and slept in her car for a week. 

It was only after Charlie knocked, and Jessica opened the 
door with a startled expression that Charlie realized that 


she’d never actually mentioned her plans to Jessica, on 
whom they all depended. She told her everything, and 
Jessica, hesitantly, offered to let her stay. Charlie had slept 
on the floor the rest of the summer, and as the fall semester 
approached, Jessica didn’t ask her to leave. 

“It’s nice to have someone who knows me here,” she had 
said, and uncharacteristically, Charlie hugged her. 

Charlie had never cared about high school. She never 
paid much attention in her classes, but As and Bs came 
easily for her. She had never really thought about liking or 
disliking her subjects, though sometimes one teacher or 
another would make her feel a spark of interest for a year. 

Charlie hadn’t thought much beyond the end of the 
Summer, but as she idly flipped through Jessica’s course 
catalog and saw advanced courses in robotics, something 
clicked into place. St. George was among the colleges she’d 
been accepted into earlier that year, though she hadn’t 
really intended to go to any of them. Now, however, she 
went to the administrative office and pleaded her case until 
she was allowed to enroll, despite having missed the 
deadline by months. There’s still so much | don’t 
understand. Charlie wanted to learn, and the things she 
wanted to learn were very specific. 

Of course there were things she had to learn before a 
robotics course would make any sense at all. Math had 
always been straightforward, functional, sort of like a game 
to Charlie; you did the thing you were supposed to do and 
got the answer. But it had never been a very interesting 
game. It was fun to learn something new, but then you had 
to keep doing it for weeks or months, bored out of your 
Skull. That was high school. But in her first calculus class, 
something had happened. It was as if she’d been laying 


bricks for years, forced to work slowly, seeing nothing but 
her mortar and her trowel. Then suddenly someone pulled 
her back a few steps and said, “Here, look, you’ve been 
building this castle. Go play inside!” 

“And that’s all for today,” Professor Treadwell said at last. 
Charlie looked down at her paper, realizing she’d never 
stopped moving her pencil. She had worn dark lines right 
through the page, and drawn on the desk. She rubbed the 
marks halfheartedly with her sleeve, then opened her binder 
to put away her notes. Arty poked his head over her 
shoulder, and she closed it hastily, but he had already 
gotten a good look. 

“What is that, a secret code? Abstract art?” 

“It’s just math,” Charlie said a little curtly, and put the 
notebook in her bag. Arty was cute in a goofy way. He had a 
pleasant face, dark eyes, and curly brown hair that seemed 
to have a life of its own. He was in three of her four classes 
and had been following her around since the beginning of 
the semester like a stray duckling. To her surprise, Charlie 
found that she didn’t mind it. 

As Charlie left the auditorium, Arty took up his now- 
accustomed place at her side. 

“So, did you decide about the project?” he asked. 

“Project?” Charlie vaguely remembered something about 
a project he wanted to do together. He gave a little nod, 
waiting for her to catch up. 

“Remember? We have to design an experiment for 
chem? | thought we could work together. You know, with 
your brains and my looks ...” He trailed off, grinning. 

“Yeah, that sounds—I have to go meet someone,” she 
interrupted herself. 


“You never meet anyone,” he said, surprised, blushing 
bright red as soon as the words were out of his mouth. “1 
didn’t mean it that way. Not that it’s any of my business, 
but, who is it?” He gave a broad smile. 

“John,” Charlie said without elaboration. Arty looked 
crestfallen for a moment but recovered quickly. 

“Of course, yeah. John. Great guy,” he said teasingly. He 
raised his eyebrows, prompting for details, but she gave 
none. “I didn’t know you were—that you had a—that’s cool. 
Arty’s face took on a look of careful neutrality. Charlie 
looked at him oddly. She hadn’t meant to imply that she and 
John were a couple but she didn’t know how to correct him. 
She couldn’t explain who John was to her without telling 
Arty far more than she wanted him to know. 

They walked in silence for a minute across the main 
quad, a small, grassy square surrounded by brick and 
concrete buildings. 

“So, is John from your hometown?” Arty asked at last. 

“My hometown is thirty minutes away. This place is 
basically just an extension of it,” Charlie said. “But yeah, 
he’s from Hurricane.” Arty hesitated, then leaned in closer 
to her, glancing around as if someone might be listening. 

“| always meant to ask you,” he said. 

Charlie looked at him wearily. Don’t ask about it. 

“I’m sure people ask you about it all the time, but come 
on—you can’t blame me for being curious. That stuff about 
the murders, it’s like an urban legend around here. | mean, 
not just around here. Everywhere. Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza—” 

“Stop.” Charlie’s face was suddenly immobile. She felt as 
if moving it, making any expression at all, would require an 
arcane skill she no longer possessed. Arty’s face had 
changed, too. His easy smile drained away. He looked 


” 


almost frightened. Charlie bit the inside of her lip, willing her 
mouth to move. 

“| was just a kid when all that happened,” she said 
quietly. Arty nodded, quick and skittish. Charlie made her 
face move into a smile. “| have to go meet Jessica,” she lied. 
| have to get away from you. Arty nodded his head again 
like a bobblehead doll. She turned and walked away toward 
the dorm, not looking back. 

Charlie blinked into the sunlight. Flashes of what 
happened last year at Freddy’s were batting at her, 
Snatches of memory plucking at her clothing with cold, iron 
fingers. The hook above, poised to strike—no escape. A 
figure looming behind the stage; red matted fur barely 
concealing the metal bones of the murderous creature. 
Kneeling in pitch-dark on the cold tile floor of the bathroom, 
and then—that giant, hard plastic eye glaring through the 
crack, the hot miasma of lifeless breath on her face. And the 
other, older memory: the thought that made her ache in 
ways for which she had no words, sorrow filling her as if it 
had been wrought into her very bones. She and Sammy, her 
other self, her twin brother, were playing their quiet games 
in the familiar warmth of the costume closet. Then the 
figure appeared in the doorway, looking down on them. 
Then Sammy was gone, and the world ended for the first 
time. 

Charlie was standing outside her own dorm room, almost 
without knowing how she’d gotten there. Slowly, she pulled 
her keys from her pocket and let herself into the room. The 
lights were off; Jessica was still in class. Charlie shut the 
door behind her, checking the lock twice, and leaned back 
against it. She took a deep breath. /t’s over now. She 
straightened decisively and snapped on the overhead light, 


filling the room with a harsh illumination. The clock beside 
the bed told Charlie that she still had a little under an hour 
before John arrived—time to work on her project. 

Charlie and Jessica had divided the room with a piece of 
masking tape after their first week living together. Jessica 
suggested it jokingly, said she’d seen it in a movie, but 
Charlie had grinned and helped her measure the room. She 
knew Jessica was desperate to keep Charlie’s mess off her 
side. The result was a bedroom that looked like a “before 
and after” picture advertising either a cleaning service ora 
nuclear weapon, depending on whose side you looked at 
first. 

On Charlie’s desk there was a pillowcase, draped over 
two indistinct shapes. She went to her desk and removed it, 
folding it carefully and placing it on her chair. She looked at 
her project. 

“Hello,” she said softly. 

Two mechanical faces were held upright on metal 
structures and attached to a length of board. Their features 
were indistinct, like old statues worn away by rain, or new 
clay not yet fully sculpted. They were made of a malleable 
plastic, and where the backs of their heads ought to be 
there were instead networks of casings, microchips, and 
wires. 

Charlie bent down toward them, looking over every 
millimeter of her design, making sure everything was as 
she'd left it. She flipped a small black switch and little lights 
blinked; tiny cooling fans began to whir. 

They didn’t move right away, but there was a change. 
The vague features took on a sense of purpose. Their blind 
eyes didn’t turn to Charlie: they looked only at each other. 


“You,” said the first. Its lips moved to shape the syllable, 
but never parted. They weren’t made to open. 

“1,” the second replied, making the same soft, 
constrained movement. 

“You are,” said the first. 

“Am |?” said the second. 

Charlie watched, her hand pressed over her mouth. She 
held her breath, afraid of disturbing them. She waited, but 
they had apparently finished, and were now simply looking 
at each other. They can’t see, Charlie reminded herself. She 
turned them off and pulled the board around so that she 
could peer into their backs. She reached inside and adjusted 
a wire. 

A key slid into the lock of the door, and Charlie startled at 
the sound. She snatched the pillowcase and threw it over 
the faces as Jessica entered the room. Jessica paused in the 
doorway with a grin. 

“What was that?” she asked. 

“What?” Charlie said innocently. 

“Come on, | Know you were working on that thing you 
never let me see.” She dropped her backpack on the floor, 
then flopped dramatically back on the bed. “Anyways, I’m 
exhausted!” she announced. Charlie laughed, and Jessica 
sat up. “Come talk to me,” she said. “What’s up with you 
and John?” 

Charlie sat down on her own bed, across from Jessica. 
Despite their different lifestyles, she liked living with the 
other girl. Jessica was warm and bright, and while her ease 
as she went about the world still intimidated Charlie a little, 
now she felt like a part of it. Maybe being Jessica’s friend 
meant absorbing some of her confidence. 


“| haven’t seen him yet. | have to leave in...” She peered 
over Jessica’s shoulder at the clock. “Fifteen minutes.” 

“Are you excited?” Jessica asked. 

Charlie shrugged. “I think so,” she said. 

Jessica laughed. “You’re not sure?” 

“I’m excited,” Charlie admitted. “It’s just been a long 
time.” 

“Not that long,” Jessica pointed out. Then she looked 
thoughtful. “I guess it sort of has been, though. Everything 
is SO different since the last time we saw him.” 

Charlie cleared her throat. “So you really want to see my 
project?” she asked, surprising herself. 

“Yes!” Jessica declared, springing up from the bed. She 
followed Charlie to her desk. Charlie switched on the power 
then flung off the pillowcase like a magician. Jessica gasped 
and took an involuntary step back. “What is it?” she asked, 
her voice cautious. But before Charlie could answer, the first 
face spoke. 

“Me,” it said. 

“You,” the other replied, and they both fell silent again. 
Charlie looked at Jessica. Her friend had a pinched 
expression, like she was holding something tightly inside. 

“1,” the second face said. 

Charlie hurried to switch them off. “Why do you have 
that look on your face?” she said. 

Jessica took a deep breath and smiled at her. “I just 
haven’t had lunch yet,” she said, but something lingered in 
her eyes. 

Jessica watched as Charlie replaced the pillowcase 
lovingly over the faces, as if she were tucking a child into 
bed. She looked uncomfortably around the room. Charlie’s 
half was a disaster: clothes and books were strewn 


everywhere, but there were also the wires and computer 
parts, tools, screws, and pieces of plastic and metal Jessica 
didn’t recognize, all jumbled up together. It wasn’t just a 
mess; it was a chaotic tangle where you could lose 
anything. Or hide anything, she realized, with a pang of guilt 
at the thought. Jessica turned her attention back to Charlie. 

“What are you programming them to do?” she asked, 
and Charlie smiled proudly. 

“I’m not exactly programming them to do anything. I’m 
helping them learn on their own.” 

“Right, of course. Obviously,” Jessica said slowly. As she 
did, something caught her eye: a pair of shiny plastic eyes 
and long floppy ears were peering out from a pile of dirty 
laundry. 

“Hey, | never noticed you brought Theodore, your little 
robo-rabbit!” she exclaimed, pleased to have remembered 
the name of Charlie’s childhood toy. Before Charlie could 
respond, she picked the stuffed animal up by his ears—and 
came away with only his head. 

Jessica let out a shriek and dropped it, clapping a hand 
over her mouth. 

“I’m sorry!” Charlie said, hastily grabbing the rabbit’s 
head off the floor. “I took him apart to study; I’m using some 
of his parts in my project.” She gestured at the thing on her 
desk. 

“Oh,” Jessica said, trying to hide her dismay. She glanced 
around the room and suddenly realized that the rabbit’s 
parts were everywhere. His cotton-ball tail was on Charlie’s 
pillow, and a leg hung off the lamp above her desk. His torso 
lay in the corner, almost out of sight, ripped open savagely. 
Jessica looked at her friend’s round, cheerful face, and frizzy 


shoulder-length brown hair. Jessica closed her eyes for a 
long moment. 

Oh, Charlie, what’s wrong with you? 

“Jessica?” Charlie said. The girl’s eyes were closed, her 
expression pained. “Jessica?” This time she opened her eyes 
and gave Charlie a sudden, bright smile, turning on cheer 
like a faucet. It was disconcerting, but Charlie had gotten 
used to it. 

Jessica blinked hard, like she was resetting her brain. “So, 
are you nervous about seeing John?” she asked. Charlie 
thought for a moment. 

“No. | mean, why should | be? It’s just John, right?” 
Charlie tried to laugh, but gave up. “Jessica, | don’t know 
what to talk about!” she burst out suddenly. 

“What do you mean?” 

“I! don’t know what to talk about with him!” Charlie said. 
“If we don’t have something to talk about, then we’ll start 
talking about ... what happened last year. And | just can’t.” 

“Right.” Jessica looked thoughtful. “Maybe he won't bring 
it up,” she offered. 

Charlie sighed, glancing back at her covered experiment 
with longing. “Of course he will. It’s all we have in common.” 
She sat down heavily on her bed and slumped over. 

“Charlie, you don’t have to talk about anything you don’t 
want to talk about,” Jessica said gently. “You can always just 
cancel on him. But | don’t think John’s going to put you on 
the spot. He cares about you. | doubt what happened in 
Hurricane is what’s on his mind.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“| just mean ...” Jessica gingerly pushed aside a pile of 
laundry and sat next to Charlie, placing a hand on her knee. 


“Il just mean that maybe it’s time that you both move past 
that. And | think John is trying to.” 

Charlie looked away and stared fixedly at Theodore’s 
head, facedown on the floor. You mean, get over it? How do | 
even begin? 

Jessica’s voice softened. “This can’t be your whole life 
anymore.” 

“| know.” Charlie sighed. She decided to change the 
Subject. “How was your class, anyway?” Charlie wiped her 
eyes, hoping Jessica would take the hint. 

“Awesome.” Jessica stood and stretched, bending over to 
touch her toes and incidentally giving Charlie a chance to 
compose herself. When Jessica stood again, she was smiling 
brilliantly, back in character. “Did you know that corpses can 
be preserved in peat bogs like mummies?” 

Charlie wrinkled her nose. “I do now. So is that what 
you’re gonna do when you graduate? Crawl around in peat 
bogs looking for bodies?” 

Jessica shrugged. “Maybe.” 

“I'll get you a hazmat suit for your graduation gift,” 
Charlie joked. She looked at her watch. “Time to go! Wish 
me luck.” She brushed her hair back with her hands, 
peering into the mirror that hung on the back of the door. “1 
feel like a mess.” 

“You look great.” Jessica gave her an encouraging nod. 

“I’ve been doing sit-ups,” Charlie said awkwardly. 

“Huh?” 

“Forget it.” Charlie grabbed her backpack and headed for 
the door. 

“Go knock his socks off!” Jessica called as Charlie left. 

“| don’t know what that means!” Charlie replied, letting 
the door swing closed before she’d finished speaking. 


* OK OX 


Charlie spotted him as she approached the main entrance to 
the campus. John was leaning on the wall, reading a book. 
His brown hair was as messy as ever, and he was wearing a 
blue T-shirt and jeans, dressed more casually than the last 
time she’d seen him. 

“John!” she called, her reluctance falling away as soon as 
she saw him. He put away his book, grinning widely, and 
hurried to her. 

“Hey, Charlie,” he said. They stood there awkwardly, 
then Charlie extended her arms to hug him. He held her 
tightly for a moment then abruptly released her. 

“You got taller,” she said accusingly, and he laughed. 

“| did,” he admitted. He gave her a searching look. “You 
look exactly the same, though,” he said with a puzzled 
smile. 

“| cut my hair!” Charlie said in mock-outrage. She ran her 
fingers through it, demonstrating. 

“Oh yeah!” he said. “I like it. | just mean, you’re the 
same girl | remember.” 

“I’ve been doing sit-ups,” Charlie said with a rising panic. 

“Huh?” John gave her a confused look. 

“Never mind. Are you hungry?” Charlie asked. “I have 
about an hour before my next class. We could get a burger. 
There’s a dining hall not far from here.” 

“Yeah, that would be great,” John said. Charlie pointed 
across the quad. 

“That way, come on.” 


“So what are you doing here?” Charlie asked as they sat 
down with their trays. “Sorry,” she added. “Did that sound 
rude?” 

“Not rude at all, although | would have also accepted, 
‘John, to what circumstance do | owe the pleasure of this 
delightful reunion?’” 

“Yeah, that sounds like me,” Charlie said drily. “But 
seriously, what are you doing here?” 

“Got a job.” 

“In St. George?” she asked. “Why?” 

“In Hurricane, actually,” he said, his voice self- 
consciously casual. 

“Aren’t you in school somewhere?” Charlie asked. 

John blushed, looking down at his plate for a moment. “1 
was going to, but ... it’s a lot of money to read books when a 
library card is free, you Know? My cousin got me a job in 
construction, and I’m working on my writing when | can. | 
figured even if I’m gonna be an artist, | don’t have to be a 
starving one.” He took an illustrative bite of his hamburger, 
and Charlie grinned. 

“So why here?” she insisted, and he held up a finger as 
he finished chewing. 

“The storm,” he said. Charlie nodded. The storm had hit 
Hurricane before Charlie came to St. George, and people 
talked about it in capital letters: The Storm. It wasn’t the 
worst the area had ever seen, but it was close. A tornado 
had risen up from nowhere and ripped through whole towns, 
razing one house to the ground with sinister precision, while 
leaving the one next to it untouched. There hadn’t been 
much damage in St. George, but Hurricane had seen real 
destruction. 

“How bad is it?” Charlie asked, keeping her tone light. 


“You haven't been?” John said incredulously, and it was 
Charlie’s turn to look awkwardly away. She shook her head. 
“It’s bad in places,” he said. “Mostly on the outskirts of 
town. Charlie ... | assumed you’d been.” He bit his lip. 

“What?” Something about his expression was worrying 
her. 

“Your dad’s house, it was one of the ones that got hit,” 
he said. 

“Oh.” Something leaden was growing in Charlie’s chest. 
“| didn’t know.” 

“You really didn’t even go back to check?” 

“| didn’t think of it,” Charlie said. That’s not true. She'd 
thought a thousand times of going back to her father’s 
house. But it had never occurred to her that the house 
might have been hit in the storm. In her mind, it was 
impregnable, unchanging. It would always be there, just as 
her father had left it. She closed her eyes and pictured it. 
The front steps sagged in disrepair, but the house itself 
stood like a fortress, protecting what was inside. “Is it— 
gone?” Charlie asked, the words faint. 

“No,” John said quickly. “No, it’s still there, just damaged. 
| don’t know how much; | just drove by. | didn’t think | should 
go there without you.” 

Charlie nodded, only half listening. She felt far away. She 
could see John, hear him, but there was a layer of 
something between them, between her and everything else, 
everything but the house itself. 

“! would have thought—didn’t your aunt tell you what 
happened?” John asked. 

“| have to get to class,” Charlie said. “It’s that way.” She 
gestured vaguely. 


“Charlie, have you been okay?” She didn’t look at him, 
and he placed his hand over hers. She still couldn’t look up. 
She didn’t want him to see her face. 

“Okay,” she repeated, then slipped her hand out from 
under his and shrugged her shoulders up and down, like she 
was trying to get something off her back. “I had my 
birthday,” she offered, and she finally leveled her gaze to 
meet his. 

“I’m sorry | missed it,” John said. 

“No, no, that’s not ...” She tipped her head from side to 
side, as if she could level out her thoughts, too. “Do you 
remember how | had a twin?” 

“What?” John sounded puzzled. “Of course | do. I’m sorry, 
Charlie, is that what you meant about your birthday?” She 
nodded, making tiny motions. John held out his hand again, 
and she took it. She could feel his pulse through his thumb. 

“Ever since we left Hurricane ... You know how twins are 
Supposed to be connected, have some kind of special 
bond?” 

“Sure,” he said. 

“Ever since we left—ever since | found out he was real— 
I’ve felt like he was there with me. | know he’s not. He’s 
dead, but for that whole year, | didn’t feel alone anymore.” 

“Charlie.” John’s hand tightened on hers. “You know 
you're not alone.” 

“No, | mean really not alone. Like | have another self: 
someone who’s a part of me and is always with me. I’ve had 
these feelings before, but they came and went, and | didn’t 
pay much attention to them. | didn’t know they meant 
something. Then when | learned the truth, and those 
memories started coming back to me—John, | felt whole ina 
way | don’t even know how to describe.” Her eyes began to 


fill with tears and she pulled her hand back to brush them 
away. 

“Hey,” he said softly. “It’s okay. That’s great, Charlie. I’m 
glad you have that.” 

“No. No, that’s the thing. | don’t!” She met his eyes, 
desperate for him to understand what she was so 
awkwardly trying to say. “He’s disappeared. That sense of 
completeness is gone.” 

“What?” 

“It happened on my birthday. | woke up and | just felt—” 
She sighed, searching. There wasn’t a word for it. 

“Alone?” John said. 

“Incomplete.” She took a deep breath, pulling herself 
back together. “But the thing is, it’s not just loss. It’s—it’s 
like he’s trapped somewhere. | have these dreams where | 
can fee/ him on the other side of something, like he’s so 
close to me, but he’s stuck somewhere. Like he’s in a box, 
or I’m in a box. | can’t tell.” 

John stared at her, momentarily speechless. Before he 
could figure out what to say, Charlie stood abruptly. “I need 
to leave.” 

“Are you sure? You haven’t even eaten,” he said. 

“I’m sorry—” She broke off. “John, it’s so good to see 
you.” She hesitated then turned to walk away, possibly for 
good. She knew she'd disappointed him. 

“Charlie, would you like to go out with me tonight?” 
John’s voice sounded stiff, but his eyes were warm. 

“Sure, that would be great,” she said, giving a half smile. 
“Don’t you have to get back to work tomorrow, though?” 

“It’s only half an hour away,” John said. He cleared his 
throat. “But | meant, do you want to go out with me?” 

“I just said yeah,” Charlie repeated, slightly irritated. 


John sighed. “I mean on a date, Charlie.” 

“Oh.” Charlie stared at him for a moment. “Right.” You 
don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Jessica’s 
voice echoed in her head. And yet ... she realized she was 
smiling. 

“Um, yes. Yes, a date. Okay, yeah. There’s a movie 
theater in town?” she hazarded, vaguely recalling that 
movies were something people did on dates. 

John nodded vigorously, apparently as lost at sea as she 
was, now that the question had been asked. “Can we have 
dinner first? There’s that Thai place down the street. | can 
meet you there around eight?” 

“Yeah, sounds good. ’Bye!” Charlie grabbed her 
backpack and hurried out the dining room door, realizing as 
she stepped into the sunshine that she’d left him to clean 
up their table alone. Sorry. 

As Charlie headed across the quad to her next class, her 
step grew more purposeful. This was a basic computer 
science class. Writing code wasn’t as exciting as what Dr. 
Treadwell taught, but Charlie still liked it. It was absorbing, 
detailed work. A single error could ruin everything. 
Everything? She thought of her impending date. The idea 
that a single error could ruin everything suddenly carried an 
awful weight. 

Charlie hurried up the steps to the building and stopped 
Short as a man blocked her path. 

It was Clay Burke. 

“Hey, Charlie.” He smiled, but his eyes were grave. 
Charlie hadn’t seen Hurricane’s chief of police—her friend 
Carlton’s father—since the night they’d escaped Freddy’s 
together. Looking now at his weathered face, she felt a rush 
of fear. 


“Mr. Burke, er, Clay. What are you doing here?” 

“Charlie, do you have a second?” he asked. Her heart 
sped up. 

“Is Carlton okay?” she asked urgently. 

“Yes, he’s fine,” Burke assured her. “Walk with me. Don’t 
worry about being late. I’ll give you a note for class. At least, 
| think an officer of the law has authority do that.” He 
winked, but Charlie didn’t smile. Something was wrong. 

Charlie followed him back down the stairs. When they 
were a dozen feet from the building, Burke stopped and met 
her gaze, as if he were looking for something. 

“Charlie, we’ve found a body,” he said. “I want you to 
take a look at it.” 

“You want me to look at it?” 

“| need you to see it.” 

Me. She said the only thing she could. 

“Why? Does it have to do with Freddy’s?” 

“| don’t want to tell you anything until you’ve seen it,” 
Burke said. He started walking again, and Charlie hurried to 
keep up with his long stride. She followed him to the parking 
lot just outside the main gate, and got into his car without a 
word. Charlie settled into her seat, a strange dread stirring 
within her. Clay Burke glanced at her and she gave a sharp, 
quick nod. He pulled the car out onto the road, and they 
headed back to Hurricane. 





So, how are you enjoying your classes?” Clay Burke asked 
in a jovial tone. 

Charlie gave him a sardonic look. “Well, this is the first 
murder of the semester. So things have been going fine.” 

Burke didn’t answer, apparently aware that further 
attempts to lighten the mood would fail. Charlie looked out 
the window. She thought often of going back to her father’s 
house, but each time the memory of the place rose up she 
slammed it back down with almost physical force, cramming 
it into the tiny corners of her mind to gather dust. Now 
something was stirring in the dusty corners, and she feared 
she might not be able to keep it away much longer. 

“Chief Burke—Clay,” Charlie said. “How’s Carlton been?” 

He smiled. “Carlton’s doing great. | tried to convince him 
to stay close for college, but he and Betty were adamant. 


Now he’s out east, studying acting.” 

“Acting?” Charlie laughed, surprising herself. 

“Well, he was always a prankster,” Clay said. “I figured 
acting was the next logical step.” 

Charlie smiled. “Did he ever ...” She looked out the 
window again. “Did you and he ever talk about what 
happened?” she asked with her face turned away. She could 
see Clay’s reflection faintly in the window, distorted by the 
glass. 

“Carlton talks to his mother more than he talks to me,” 
he said plainly. Charlie waited for him to go on, but he 
remained silent. Though she and Jessica lived together, from 
the beginning they had an unspoken pact never to talk 
about Freddy’s, except in the barest terms. She didn’t know 
if Jessica was sometimes consumed by the memories, as 
she was. Maybe Jessica had nightmares, too. 

But Charlie and Clay had no such pact. She took in 
Shallow, quick breaths, waiting to hear how far he would go. 
“| think Carlton had dreams about it,” Clay said finally. 

“Sometimes in the morning he would come downstairs 
looking like he hadn’t slept in a week, but he never told me 
what was going on.” 

“What about you? Do you think about it?” She was 
overstepping but Clay didn’t seem ruffled. 

“I try not to,” he said gravely. “You know, Charlie, when 
terrible things happen you can do one of two things: you 
can leave them behind or you can let them consume you.” 

Charlie set her jaw. “I’m not my father,” she said. 

Clay looked immediately contrite. “I know, | didn’t mean 
that,” he said. “I just meant you have to look forward.” He 
flashed a nervous grin. “Of course, my wife would say 


there’s a third thing: you can process the terrible things and 
come to terms with them. She’s probably right.” 

“Probably,” Charlie said distractedly. 

“And what about you? How are you doing, Charlie?” Clay 
asked. It was the question she had practically solicited, but 
She didn’t know how to answer it. 

“| have dreams about it, | guess,” she muttered. 

“You guess?” he asked in a careful tone. “What kind of 
dreams?” 

Charlie looked out the window again. There was a weight 
pressing on her chest. What kind of dreams? 

Nightmares, but not of Freddy’s. A shadow in the 
doorway of the costume closet where we play. Sammy 
doesn’t see; he’s playing with his truck. But | look up. The 
shadow has eyes. Then everything is moving—hangers 
rattle and costumes sway. A toy truck drops hard on the 
floor. 

I’m left alone. The air ts growing thin, I’m running out. It’s 
getting hard to breathe and I'll die like this, alone, in the 
dark. | pound against the closet wall, calling for help. | know 
he’s there. Sammy is on the other side, but he doesn’t 
answer my cries as | begin to gasp, choking for air. It is too 
dark to see, but even so! know my vision Is going black, 
and in my chest my heart is slowing, each pump swelling 
me with pain as | struggle to call his name one more time— 

“Charlie?” Clay had pulled over and stopped the car 
without her noticing. Now he was looking at her with his 
piercing detective’s gaze. She looked at him for a moment 
before she could remember how to answer, and she made 
herself smile. 

“I’ve mostly been focused on school,” she said. 


Clay smiled at her but it didn’t touch his eyes. He looked 
worried. He’s wishing he hadn’t brought me, she thought. 

He opened his door but didn’t get out of the car. The sun 
had begun to set as they drove, and now it was verging on 
dark. The turn signal was still on, flashing yellow onto the 
dirt road. Charlie watched it for a moment, hypnotized. She 
felt as if she might never move again, just sit here watching 
the endless, measured blinking of the light. Clay switched 
the signal off, and Charlie blinked, as if a spell had been 
broken. She straightened her spine and unbuckled her seat 
belt. 

“Charlie,” Clay said, not looking directly at her. “I’m sorry 
to ask this of you, but you’re the only person who can tell 
me if this is what | think it is.” 

“Okay,” she replied, suddenly alert. Clay sighed and got 
out of the car. Charlie followed close behind him. There was 
a barbed wire fence all along the road, and there were cows 
in the field beyond it. They stood around, chewing and 
staring in the vacant way of cows. Clay lifted the top wire for 
Charlie and she climbed gingerly through. When’s the last 
time | got a tetanus shot? she wondered as a barb caught 
briefly on her T-shirt. 

She didn’t have to ask where the body was. There was a 
floodlight and a makeshift fence of caution tape strung 
between posts that jutted from the soil in a scattered 
formation. Charlie stood where she was as Burke climbed 
through the fence after her, and they both surveyed the 
area. 

The field was flat, and the grass was short and patchy, 
worn down daily by dozens of hooves. A single tree stood 
some distance from where the crime scene was marked. 
Charlie thought it was an oak. Its branches were long and 


ancient, heavy with leaves. There was something wrong 
with the air; along with the smell of cow dung and mud 
wafted the sharp, metallic scent of blood. 

For some reason, Charlie looked at the cows again. They 
weren't as calm as she’d assumed. They shifted back and 
forth on their feet, clustering in groups. None of them came 
anywhere near the floodlight. As if sensing her scrutiny, one 
of them lowed a mournful cry. Charlie heard Clay’s sharp 
intake of breath. 

“Maybe we should ask them what happened,” Charlie 
said. In the stillness, her voice carried. Clay started toward 
the floodlight. Charlie followed closely, not wanting to fall 
too far behind. It wasn’t just the cows; a weight of 
something wrong hung over the place. There was no sound, 
only the shocked quiet that follows a terrible violence. 

Clay stopped beside the marked-out spot and ushered 
Charlie forward, still saying nothing. Charlie looked. 

It was a man, stretched in a ghastly posture on his back, 
his limbs contorted impossibly. In the glaring, unnatural 
light, the scene looked staged; he might have been an 
enormous doll. His whole body was drenched red with blood. 
His clothes were torn, almost shredded, and through the 
holes Charlie thought she could see ripped-up skin, some 
bone, and other things she couldn’t identify. 

“What do you make of it?” Clay said softly, as if he were 
afraid of disturbing her. 

“| need to get closer,” she said. Clay climbed over the 
yellow tape, and Charlie followed. She knelt in the mud 
beside the man’s head, the knees of her jeans soaking with 
mud. He was middle-aged, white, his hair short and gray. His 
eyes, thankfully, were closed. The rest of his face slack ina 
way that could almost have looked like sleep, but did not. 


She leaned forward to peer at the man’s neck and blanched, 
but didn’t look away. 

“Charlie, are you all right?” Clay asked, and she held up a 
hand. 

“I’m fine.” She knew those wounds; she’d seen the scars 
they left. On each side of the dead man’s neck was a deep, 
curved gash. This was what had killed him. It would have 
been instantaneous. Or maybe not. Suddenly she pictured 
Dave, the guard at Freddy’s, the murderer. She had watched 
him die. She’d triggered the spring locks and seen his 
Startled eyes as the locks drove into his neck. She’d 
watched his body jolt and seize as the costume he wore 
shot jagged metal through his vital organs. Charlie stared at 
this stranger’s wounds. She reached down and ran her 
finger along the edge of the cut on the man’s neck. What 
were you doing? 

“Charlie!” Clay said in alarm, and Charlie drew back her 
hand. 

“Sorry,” she said self-consciously, wiping her bloody 
fingers on her jeans. “Clay, it was one of them. His neck, he 
died like ...” She stopped talking. Clay had been there; his 
son had almost died the same way. But if this was 
happening again, he had to know what he was dealing with. 

“You remember how Dave died, right?” she asked. 

Clay nodded. “Hard thing to forget.” He shook his head, 
patiently waiting for her to get to the point. 

“These suits, like the rabbit suit that Dave was wearing, 
they can be worn like costumes. Or they can move around 
on their own, as fully functional robots.” 

“Sure, you just put the suit on a robot,” Clay said. 

“Not exactly ... The robots are always inside the suits; 
they’re made of interlocking parts that are held back 


against the inner lining of the costumes by spring locks. 
When you want an animatronic, you just trip the locks, and 
the robotic parts unfold inside, filling the suit.” 

“But if there’s someone inside the suit when the locks are 
tripped ... ,” Clay said, catching on. 

“Right. Thousands of sharp metal parts shoot through 
your whole body. Like, well—that,” she finished, gesturing at 
the man on the ground. 

“How hard is it to accidentally trigger the spring locks?” 
Clay asked. 

“It depends on the costume. If it’s well cared for, pretty 
hard. If it’s old, or poorly designed—it could happen. And if 
it’s not an accident ...” 

“Is that what happened here?” 

Charlie hesitated. Dave’s image came to her again, this 
time alive, when he bared his torso to show them the scars 
he bore. Dave had once survived being crushed like this, 
though the second time had killed him. Somehow he had 
survived the lethal unfolding of a costume, a thing that 
should have been impossible. But it had left its marks. She 
cleared her throat and started again. “I need to see his 
chest,” she said. “Can you get his shirt off?” 

Clay nodded and took a pair of plastic gloves from his 
pocket. He tossed them to Charlie but they fell to the 
ground unnoticed. “If I'd Known you were going to stick your 
fingers in the corpse, I’d have given these to you earlier,” 
he said drily. He put on a pair of his own and produced a 
knife from somewhere on his belt. The man was wearing a T- 
Shirt. Clay dropped to his knees, took hold of the bottom, 
and began to saw through the cloth. The sound of wet, 
tearing fabric cut through the silent field like a cry of pain. 
At last he was done, and he pulled back the shirt. Dried 


blood clung to the fabric, and as Clay pulled it back the 
body pulled with it, giving a brief, false sense of life. Charlie 
bent over, picturing Dave’s scars. She compared the pattern 
to the wounds she saw here. This is what happened to Dave. 
Each piercing of the man’s flesh seemed like a killing blow; 
any one of them might have punctured something vital, or 
simply been deep enough to drain him of blood in minutes. 
What was left of him was grotesque. 

“It was one of them,” Charlie said, looking up at Clay for 
the first time since they reached the body. “He must have 
been wearing one of the costumes. It’s the only way he 
could end up like this. But ...” Charlie paused and scanned 
the field again. “Where’s the suit?” 

“What would someone be doing wearing one of those 
things out here?” Clay said. 

“Maybe he wasn’t wearing it willingly,” Charlie answered. 

Clay leaned forward and reached for the man’s open 
Shirt, pulling it closed as best he could. Together they got up 
and headed back to the car. 

As Clay drove her back to campus, Charlie stared out the 
window into the darkness. 

“Clay, what happened to Freddy’s?” she asked. “I hear it 
was torn down.” She scratched her fingernail on the car seat 
nervously. “Is that true?” 

“Yes. Well, they started to,” Clay said slowly. “We went 
through the whole place, clearing everything out. It was a 
funny thing; we couldn’t find the body of that guard, Dave.” 
He paused and looked directly at Charlie, as though 
expecting her to answer for something. 

Charlie felt the warmth drain from her face. He’s dead. | 
saw him die. She closed her eyes for a moment and forced 
herself to focus. 


“That place was like a maze, though.” Clay turned his 
eyes casually back to the road. “His body probably got 
stuffed into some crevice no one will find for years.” 

“Yeah, probably buried in the rubble.” She looked down, 
trying to put the thought out of her head for the moment. 
“What about the costumes, the robots?” Clay hesitated. You 
must have known | would ask, Charlie thought with some 
annoyance. 

“Everything we took out of Freddy’s was thrown away or 
burned. Technically | should have treated it like what it was: 
a break in the missing kids case, over a decade old. 
Everything would have been bagged up and gone over. But 
no one would have believed what happened there, what we 
saw. So | took some liberties.” He glanced at Charlie, the 
Suspicious look gone from his face, and she nodded for him 
to continue. Clay took a deep breath. “| treated it only as 
the murder of my officer; you remember Officer Dunn. We 
recovered his body, closed the case, and | ordered the 
building to be demolished.” 

“What about ...” Charlie paused, trying not to let her 
frustration show. “What about Freddy, and Bonnie, and 
Chica, and Foxy?” What about the children, the children who 
were killed and hidden inside each one of them? 

“They were all there,” Clay said gravely. “They were 
lifeless, Charlie. | don’t know what else to tell you.” Charlie 
didn’t respond. 

“As far as the demolition crew was concerned, all they’d 
found were old costumes, broken robots, and two dozen 
folding tables. And | didn’t correct them,” he said with 
hesitation in his voice. “You know how these things go. 
Whether building up or tearing down, it takes time. From 


what | hear, the storm hit and suddenly everyone was 
needed elsewhere; the demolition was put on hold.” 

“So it’s all still standing there?” Charlie asked, and Clay 
gave her a warning look. 

“Some parts are standing, but for all intents and 
purposes, it’s gone. And don’t even think about going back 
there. There’s no reason to and you'll get yourself killed. 
Like | said, everything that mattered is gone anyway.” 

“| don’t want to go back there,” Charlie said softly. 

When they reached the campus, Clay let her out where 
he’d found her. She’d only taken a few steps from the car, 
however, when he called to her from the car window. “I feel 
like | need to tell you one more thing,” he said. “We found 
blood at the scene, in the main dining room where Dave ...” 
He looked around cautiously. There was something 
unseemly, talking about gruesome things on the sheltered 
grounds of the campus. “It wasn’t real blood, Charlie.” 

“What are you talking about?” Charlie took a step back 
toward the car. 

“It was, like, costume blood, or movie blood. It was pretty 
convincing, though. We didn’t realize it was fake until the 
crime lab looked at it under a microscope.” 

“Why are you telling me this?” Charlie asked, although 
she knew the answer. The terrible possibility was pounding 
in her mind like a headache. 

“He survived once,” Clay said plainly. 

“Well, he didn’t survive the second time.” Charlie turned 
to walk away. 

“I’m sorry you have to be involved in this,” Clay called. 

Charlie didn’t answer. She looked down at the pavement 
and clenched her teeth. Clay raised the window without 
another word and drove away. 





Charlie checked her watch: she was on time to meet John, 
even early. She passed under a streetlight and looked down 
at herself, checking her clothes. Oh no. The knees of her 
jeans were wet with mud, and there was a dark stain where 
she had wiped her fingers clean of the dead man’s blood. / 
can’t show up covered in blood. He’s seen me like this too 
many times already. She sighed and turned around. 

Thankfully, Jessica was gone when she got back to the 
room. Charlie didn’t want to talk about what had just 
happened. Clay hadn’t explicitly told her to keep it a secret, 
but she was fairly sure she shouldn’t broadcast her private 
visit to a crime scene. Charlie cast a glance at the faces 
under their pillowcase cover, but didn’t go to them. She 
wanted to show her project to John, but, like Jessica, he 
might not understand. 


She opened a dresser drawer and stared down at the 
contents without registering them. In her mind, she saw the 
body again, its limbs splayed out as if it had been thrown 
down where it lay. She covered her face with her hands, 
taking deep breaths. She had seen the scars, but she’d 
never seen the wounds of the spring locks fresh. Now 
Dave’s eyes came to her, the look of shock just before he 
fell. Charlie could feel the locks in her hands, feel them 
resist, then give way and snap. That’s what happened. 
That’s what | did. She swallowed, and slid her hands down 
to her throat. 

Charlie shook her head like a dog shaking off a wet coat. 
She looked at the open drawer again, concentrating. / need 
to change. What Is all this? The drawer was filled with 
brightly colored shirts, all unfamiliar. Charlie startled, a dim 
panic seizing her. What is all this? She picked up a T-shirt 
and dropped it again, then forced herself to take a deep 
breath. Jessica. They’re Jessica’s. She’d opened the wrong 
drawer. 

Get it together, Charlie, she told herself sternly, and 
somehow it sounded like Aunt Jen’s voice in her head. 
Despite everything that lay between her and her aunt, just 
imagining her cold, authoritative voice made Charlie a little 
calmer. She nodded to herself, then grabbed what she 
needed: a clean T-shirt and jeans. She dressed hurriedly, 
then left to meet John, her stomach fluttering, half-excited, 
half-sick. A date, she thought. What if it doesn’t go well? 
Worse, what if it does? 

As she neared the Thai restaurant, she saw that John was 
already there. He was waiting outside, but he didn’t look 
impatient. He didn’t spot her right away, and Charlie slowed 
her pace for a moment, watching him. He seemed at ease, 


gazing into the middle distance with a vague, pleasant 
expression. He had an air of confidence he hadn’t possessed 
a year ago. It wasn’t that he’d been unsure of himself then, 
but now he looked ... adult. Maybe it was because he’d gone 
straight to work after high school. Maybe it was what 
happened last year at Freddy’s, Charlie thought with an 
unexpected sense of envy. Although she’d moved out on her 
own, to a new home and a new college, she felt as if the 
experience had left her more a child, not less. Not a cared- 
for or protected child, but one who was vulnerable and 
unmoored. A child who had looked under the bed and seen 
the monsters. 

John noticed her and waved. Charlie waved back and 
smiled, the expression unforced. Date or not, it was good to 
see him. 

“How was your last class?” he said by way of greeting, 
and Charlie shrugged. 

“| don’t know. It was class. How was the rest of work?” 

He grinned. “It was work. Are you hungry?” 

“Yes,” Charlie said decisively. They headed inside and 
were motioned to a table. 

“Have you been here before?” John asked, and Charlie 
shook her head. 

“| don’t get out much,” she said. “I don’t even come out 
to town that often. The college is sort of its own little world, 
you know?” 

“| can imagine,” John said cheerfully. Now that the secret 
was out that he wasn’t in school, he’d apparently shed his 
earlier discomfort. “Isn’t it a little bit ... ?” he searched for 
words. “Doesn't it feel a little isolated?” 

“Not really,” Charlie said. “If it’s a prison, it’s not one of 
the worst.” 


“Il didn’t mean to compare it to a prison!” John said. “So, 
come on, what are you studying?” 

Charlie hesitated. There was no reason not to tell John, 
but it seemed too soon, too risky to announce that she was 
eagerly following in her father’s footsteps. She didn’t want 
to tell him she was studying robotics until she had some 
idea of how he would respond. Just like with her project. 

“Most colleges make you do a set of classes your first 
year: English, math, everything like that,” she said, hoping it 
would sound like a response. Suddenly Charlie didn’t want 
to talk about school; she wasn’t sure she could keep up a 
conversation about anything, really. She looked at John, and 
for a moment imagined the spring-lock wounds in his neck. 
Her eyes widened and she bit the inside of her cheek, trying 
to ground herself. 

“Tell me about your job,” she said, and saw her own 
hesitation mirrored on his face. 

“| mean, | like the work,” he said. “More than | thought | 
would, actually. There’s something about doing physical 
labor that kind of frees my mind. It’s like meditation. It’s 
hard, though, really hard. Construction workers always make 
it look so easy, but it turns out it takes a while to build up 
that kind of muscle.” He stretched his arms comically over 
his head, and Charlie laughed, but couldn’t help noticing 
that he was clearly well on his way to that kind of muscle. 
John leaned to his left and gave his armpit a quick sniff, then 
made a look of mock-embarrassment. Charlie looked down 
at her menu and giggled. 

“Do you already know what you want?” she said. Then 
the waitress appeared out of nowhere, as if she’d been 
listening nearby. 


John ordered, and Charlie froze. She’d said it just to say 
something, but she didn’t know what to get. Suddenly she 
noticed all the prices. Everything on the menu was 
impossibly expensive. She hadn’t even thought about 
money when she accepted John’s invitation, but now her 
mind jumped to her wallet, and her nearly empty bank 
account. 

Misreading her expression, John leaped in. “If you’ve 
never had Thai food, Pad Thai is good,” he suggested. “1 
should have asked,” he said awkwardly. “If I’m buying a lady 
dinner, | should make sure she likes the food!” He looked 
embarrassed, but Charlie was flooded with relief. Buying a 
lady dinner. 

“No, I’m sure I'll like it,” she said. “Pad Thai, thanks,” she 
told the waitress, then gave John a mock-glare. “Who are 
you calling a lady?” she said playfully, and he laughed. 

“What's wrong with that?” 

“It just sounds weird, you calling me a lady,” Charlie said. 
“So anyway, what do you all day besides meditate?” 

“Well, the days are long, and like | said, I’m still writing, 
so there’s that. It’s strange being in Hurricane again, 
though. | didn’t mean to put down roots.” 

“Put down roots?” 

“Like, join a bowling team or something. Ties to the 
community, things like that.” 

Charlie nodded. She of all people understood the need to 
remain apart. “Why did you take the job here, then?” she 
asked. “I know they needed people because of the storm, 
but you didn’t have to come, right? People are still building 
things in other places.” 

“That’s true,” he admitted. “To be honest, it was more 
about getting away from where | was.” 


“Sounds familiar,” Charlie muttered, too softly for him to 
hear. 

The waitress returned with their food. Charlie took a 
quick bite of rice noodles and immediately burned her 
mouth. She grabbed her water glass and drank. “Yikes, 
that’s hot!” she said. “So what were you getting away 
from?” She asked the question casually, as if the answer 
would be simple. Do you have nightmares, too? She held 
back the words, waiting for him to speak. 

John hesitated. “A... girl, actually,” he said. He paused, 
searching for a reaction. Charlie stopped chewing; that 
wasn’t at all the answer she’d been expecting. She 
swallowed, nodding with self-conscious enthusiasm. After an 
excruciating silence, John went on. 

“We started dating the summer after ... after Freddy’s. | 
told her | wasn’t looking for anything serious, she said she 
wasn't, either. Then suddenly it was six months later, and 
we were serious. | had just started working. I’d moved out 
on my own, and had this grown-up relationship. It was a 
shock, but a good one, | guess.” He stopped, not sure 
whether he should continue. Charlie wasn’t sure she wanted 
to give him permission. 

“So, tell me about her,” she said calmly, avoiding eye 
contact. 

“She was—is, | mean. I’m not dating her, but it’s not like 
she’s dead. Her name is Rebecca. She’s pretty, | guess. 
Smart. She’s a year older than me, a college student 
studying English; has a dog. So yeah, she was all right.” 

“What happened?” 

“| don’t know,” he said. 

“Really,” Charlie said drily, and he smiled. 


“No. | felt ... on guard around her. Like there were things | 
couldn’t tell her, things she’d just never understand. It 
wasn’t because of her. She was great. But she knew | was 
holding something back; she just didn’t Know what it was.” 

“| wonder what it could have been?” Charlie asked 
quietly. The question was rhetorical; they both knew the 
answer. 

John smiled. “Well, anyway, she broke up with me, and | 
was devastated, blah, blah, blah. Actually, | don’t think | was 
that devastated.” John looked down, focusing on his food 
but not touching it. 

“Have you ever tried to tell anyone about Freddy’s?” John 
glanced back up and pointed his fork at Charlie. She shook 
her head. “It wasn’t just what happened,” he went on. “1 
can’t imagine telling that story and having her believe me, 
but it wasn’t only that. | wanted her to know the facts of it, 
but more, | wanted to tell her what it did to me. How it 
changed me.” 

“It changed all of us,” Charlie said. 

“Yeah, and not just last year. From the beginning. | didn’t 
realize it until after we’d all gone back, how much that place 
had just ... followed me.” He glanced at Charlie. “Sorry, it 
must be even weirder for you.” 

Charlie shrugged uncomfortably. “Maybe. | think it’s just 
different.” 

Her hand was resting on the table beside her water glass, 
and now John reached out to touch it. She stiffened, and he 
drew back. 

“Sorry,” he said. “I’m sorry.” 

“It’s not you,” Charlie said quickly. His dead face, the 
dead skin of his throat. She had barely noticed it at the 
time, overwhelmed by the whole experience, but now the 


feeling of the dead man’s neck came back to her. It was as if 
she were touching him right now. She could feel his skin, 
Slack and cold, and slick with blood; she could feel the blood 
on her fingers. She rubbed her hands together. They were 
clean—she knew they were clean—but still she could feel 
the blood. You’re being dramatic. 

“I'll be right back,” she said, and got up before John 
could respond. She made her way around the tables to the 
bathrooms at the back of the restaurant. It was a three-stall 
bathroom; thankfully it was empty. Charlie went straight to 
the sink and turned the hot water on full-blast. She pumped 
soap onto her hands and scrubbed them for a long time. 
She closed her eyes and focused on the feeling of hot water 
and soap, and slowly the memory of blood faded. As she 
dried her hands she looked at herself in the mirror: her 
reflection looked wrong somehow, off, as if it wasn’t herself 
she saw, but a copy. Someone else dressed as her. Get it 
together, Charlie, she thought, trying to hear the words in 
Aunt Jen’s voice, as she had before. She closed her eyes. 
Get it together. When she opened them again she was back 
in the mirror. Her reflection was her own. 

Charlie smoothed her hair, and went back out to the 
table, where John was waiting for her with a concerned 
expression. 

“Is everything okay?” he asked nervously. “Did | do 
something?” 

Charlie shook her head. “No, of course not. It’s been a 
long day, that’s all.” There’s an understatement. She 
glanced at her watch. “Do we still have time for a movie?” 
she asked. “It’s almost eight thirty.” 

“Yeah, we should go,” John said. “Are you done?” 


“Yeah, it was really good, thank you.” She smiled at him. 
“The ‘lady’ liked it.” John smiled back, visibly relaxing. He 
went to the counter to pay, and Charlie went outside, 
waiting for him on the sidewalk. Dark had fallen, and there 
was a chill in the air. Charlie wished briefly that she’d 
thought to bring a sweatshirt. John joined her after a 
moment. 

“Ready?” 

“Yeah,” Charlie said. “Where is it?” 

He looked at her for a moment and shook his head. “The 
movie was your idea, remember?” He laughed. 

“Like | said, | don’t get out much.” Charlie looked down at 
her feet. 

“The theater’s only a few blocks away.” 

They walked in silence for a while. 

“| found out what happened to Freddy’s,” she said 
without thinking, and John looked at her, surprised. 

“Really? What happened?” 

“They were tearing it down, then the storm came and 
everyone got called away. Now it’s just standing there, half 
collapsed. All the stuff is gone, though,” she added, seeing 
the question in John’s eyes. “I don’t know what they did with 
... them.” It was a lie; Charlie couldn’t tell him what had 
really happened without telling him how she knew. All those 
questions led back to the same place: the dead man in the 
field. Who were you? 

“What about your father’s house?” John asked. “Did you 
ask your aunt Jen about it? What’s she going to do with it?” 

“| don’t know,” Charlie said. “I haven’t talked to her since 
August.” She fell silent, not looking at John as they walked. 

They reached their destination, a shabby, one-screen 
movie theater named the Grand Palace. Its name was either 


ironic or wishful thinking. Emblazoned on the marquee was 
their current showing: Zombies vs. Zombies! 

“Il think it’s about zombies,” John joked as they went 
inside. 

The movie had already started. Someone onscreen was 
screaming, aS what were apparently zombies came at her 
from all sides. She was surrounded. The creatures crouched 
like wild dogs, ready to spring and devour her. They moved 
to attack—and a man grabbed her arm, pulling her to safety. 

“Charlie.” John touched her arm, whispering. “Over 
there.” He gestured to the back row. The place was half-full, 
but the back row was empty, and they made their way 
furtively to the middle. They sat, and Charlie turned her 
attention to the screen. Thank goodness, she thought. 
Maybe we can finally relax. 

She settled back in her seat, letting the images on the 
screen blur past her. Shrieks, gunfire, and thrumming music 
filled the silence between them. From the corner of her eye 
she saw John glance at her nervously. Charlie focused her 
attention on the movie. The main characters, a man and 
woman with the generic, angular good looks of the big 
screen, were shooting automatic weapons into a crowd of 
zombies. As the first ranks were killed—not killed, stopped; 
though severed in half by the guns, they still twitched on 
the ground—the ones behind climbed over their fallen 
cohorts. The camera switched back to the man and woman, 
who jumped a fence and took off running. Behind them the 
zombies kept coming, struggling forward, oblivious to the 
undead bodies they waded through. The music was urgent, 
the baseline pounding like an artificial heartbeat, and 
Charlie relaxed against the seat, letting herself be absorbed 
into it all. 


What was he doing there? The image of the dead man 
returned to her. Something about the wounds bothered her, 
but she hadn’t been able to put her finger on it. / recognized 
those wounds. They all matched what | remembered, but 
something was different. What was it? 

She sensed movement next to her, and saw John trying 
to stretch an arm toward her. Real/y? she thought. 

“Do you have enough room?” she asked him, and 
scooted away without waiting for a response. He looked 
embarrassed, but she glanced away, planting her elbow on 
the other armrest and staring fixedly at the screen. 

Enough room, that’s it. She closed her eyes, 
concentrating on the image in her head. The wounds were 
slightly larger and more spaced out. The suit he was 
wearing was bigger than the suits from Freddy’s. The man 
was probably five foot ten or five foot eleven, which means 
the suits must have been at least seven feet tall. 

Onscreen, there was quiet again, but it was short lived. 
Charlie watched, mesmerized, as the dirt spilled away of its 
own volition, moving like magic as the zombie rose. /t 
wouldn't be like that, Charlie thought definitively. /t’s not 
that easy to get out of a grave. By now the zombie onscreen 
was halfway out, crawling to the surface and looking around 
with its glassy, mindless eyes. You can’t get out that fast. 
Charlie blinked and shook her head, trying to stay focused. 

Zombies. Lifeless things. The closet was full of costumes, 
lifeless yet ever-watching, with plastic eyes and dead, 
hanging limbs. Somehow their corpselike stares had never 
bothered her, or Sammy. They liked to touch the fur, 
sometimes put it in their mouths and giggle at the funny 
way it felt. Some was old and matted; some new and soft. 
The closet was their place, just for the two of them. 


Sometimes they babbled together in words that had 
meaning only to them; sometimes they played side by side, 
lost in separate worlds of make-believe. But they were 
always together. Sammy was playing with a truck when the 
shadow came. He ran it back and forth on the floor, not 
noticing that their ribbon of light had been cut off. Charlie 
turned and saw the shadow, so still he could be an i/lusion, 
just another costume out of place. Then the sudden 
movement, the chaos of fabric and eyes. The truck clanked 
as it fell to the floor, and then: loneliness. A dark so 
complete that she began to believe she’d never seen at all. 
The memories of sight had only been a dream, a trick of the 
utter blackness. She tried to call his name—she could feel 
him nearby—but all around her were solid walls. “Can you 
hear me? Sammy? Let me out! Sammy!” But he was gone, 
and he was never there again. 

“Charlie, are you okay?” 

“What?” Charlie looked at John. She realized she’d pulled 
her feet up on the chair and was hugging her knees to her 
chest. She sat back, setting her shoes back on the floor. 
John gave her a concerned look. “I’m fine,” she whispered, 
and gestured to the screen. 

John put a hand on her forearm. “Are you sure you're 
Okay?” he asked. 

Charlie stared straight ahead. Now there were people 
running, the zombies lurching after them. “This doesn’t 
make sense,” Charlie muttered, mostly to herself. 

“What?” John leaned toward her. 

Charlie didn’t move, but she repeated herself. “It doesn’t 
make sense. Zombies don’t make sense; if they’re dead, the 
central nervous system is shot, and they can’t do any of 
this. If there’s a functioning central nervous system, which 


has somehow decayed to the point that movement and 
thought are possible, but severely hindered, fine. If it makes 
them violent, fine. But why would they want to eat brains? It 
doesn’t make sense.” 

That man wouldn’t have been able to walk on his own in 
a Suit so oversized. He didn’t walk into that field; the suit 
did. The animatronic was carrying him inside. It walked into 
that field of its own accord. 

“Maybe it’s symbolic,” John suggested, eager to engage, 
however odd the conversation. “You know, like the idea that 
you eat your enemy’s heart to gain their power? Maybe the 
zombie eats its enemy’s brain to gain its ... central nervous 
system?” He glanced at Charlie, but she was only half 
listening. 

“Okay,” she said. She’d been irritated by the movie, now 
she was irritated by the conversation she herself had 
introduced. “I'll be right back,” she told John, and got up 
without waiting for him to respond. She made her way out of 
the row, through the lobby, and out the door. On the 
sidewalk, she took a deep breath and felt an intense relief at 
the wash of fresh air. Dreams about being trapped are 
common, she reminded herself. She’d looked it up when 
they began. They were only slightly less common than 
dreams of showing up to class naked, plummeting from a 
great height, or having your teeth all suddenly fall out. But 
this didn’t feel like a dream. 

Charlie jostled her thoughts back to the present, where 
even the crime scene of a gruesome murder seemed like a 
safer place to keep them. 

There must be tracks. He didn’t walk there himself. There 
must be some clue of what carried him into that field, and 
where it came from. 


Charlie shivered. She went back inside the building. 
John’s going to think I’m nuts. She arrived at the swinging 
theater doors and stopped—she couldn't do it. She had to 
know. There was a young man at the concession stand, and 
she asked him if the place had a pay phone. He pointed 
silently to his right, and Charlie went, fishing in her pocket 
for a quarter, and for Chief Burke’s card. 

She dialed carefully, pausing between numbers to check 
the card again, as if the writing might have changed since 
She looked. Clay Burke answered on the third ring. 

“Burke.” 

“Clay? It’s Charlie.” 

“Charlie? What’s wrong?” He was instantly alert; Charlie 
could picture him leaping to his feet, ready to run. 

“Nothing, I’m fine,” she assured him. “Everything is okay, 
| just wanted to see if you’ve found anything else.” 

“Not so far,” he told her. 

“Oh.” Burke let the silence stretch between them, and 
Charlie finally broke it. “Is there anything else you can tell 
me? | know it’s confidential, but you’ve brought me in this 
far. Please, if there’s anything else you know. Anything else 
you found, anything you know about the man—the victim.” 

“No,” Clay said slowly. “I mean, I'll let you know when we 
find something.” 

“Okay,” Charlie said. “Thanks.” 

“T’ll be in touch.” 

“Okay.” Charlie hung up the phone before he could say 
good-bye. “I don’t believe you,” she said to the phone on 
the wall. 

Back in the theater, her eyes took a moment to adjust as 
she inched along the back row toward her seat, careful not 
to make noise. John looked up at her with a smile as she sat 


down, but didn’t say anything. Charlie smiled back with a 
grim determination, and settled back in her seat, then 
scooted over until her shoulder was pressed against his. 
From behind her head, she heard him make a surprised 
noise, then he shifted, putting his arm around her shoulders. 
He gripped her tightly for a moment, halfway to a hug, and 
Charlie leaned in a little, unsure how else to reciprocate. 

What if someone put him in the costume, like some kind 
of wind-up deathtrap? Stuck him inside that thing, then sent 
it walking until the spring locks went off. But who would 
know how to do that? Why would someone do that? 

“Did | miss anything?” Charlie asked, though she hadn’t 
paid any attention to the first half of the movie anyway. It 
was daytime onscreen, and it looked like there were more 
people, holed up in some sort of bunker. Charlie couldn’t 
remember which of them had been the original characters. 
She wriggled in her seat; John’s arm around her had relaxed, 
but now the arm of the seat was digging into her side. He 
started to move away, but she settled herself again. 

“No, it’s okay,” she whispered, and his arm circled her 
again. “Just get on with it,” Charlie said, flustered. John 
Startled. 

“Sorry, | didn’t want to be too aggressive.” 

“No, not you.” Charlie gestured toward the screen. “They 
should just build a minefield around the bunker and wait for 
them to all blow up. The end.” 

“Il think that’s actually what they do in the sequel, but 
we'll have to wait to watch it for ourselves.” He winked. 

“There’s another one?” She sighed. 

When the credits started to roll, they gathered their 
things and headed to the exits with the rest of the small 


crowd, not speaking until they got outside. On the sidewalk, 
they stopped. 

“This has been nice,” John said, sounding—somehow— 
like he meant it, and Charlie laughed, then groaned, 
covering her face with both hands. 

“This has been awful. This has been the worst date ever. 
I’m so sorry. Thanks for lying, though.” 

John gave an uncertain smile. “It was nice to see you,” 
he said with cautious levity. 

“It’s just—can we go somewhere to talk?” 

John nodded, and Charlie started back toward campus 
with him following behind. 

The quad was usually empty late at night, or at least 
mostly empty. There was always someone walking across, 
some student finishing up late night work in a lab, some 
couple ensconced in a dark corner. Tonight was no different, 
and it was easy enough to find their own dark corner to talk. 
Charlie sat down under a tree, and John copied her, then 
waited for her to talk as she stared at the gap between two 
buildings, where you could almost see the woods. 

Finally, he prompted her. “So what’s up?” 

“Right.” She met his eyes. “Clay came to see me today.” 
John’s eyes widened, but he didn’t say anything. “He took 
me to see a body,” Charlie went on. “He had died inside one 
of the mascot costumes.” 

John was frowning; she could almost see his thoughts, 
working through what this meant, and why it involved 
Charlie. 

“That’s not all: Clay told me that they found blood in the 
main dining room at Freddy’s. Fake blood.” 

John’s head jerked up. “You think Dave’s alive?” 


Charlie shrugged. “Clay didn’t come out and Say it. But 
all those scars—he had survived the spring locks of a 
mascot costume before. He must have known how to 
escape the building.” 

“It didn’t look to me like he escaped,” John said 
doubtfully. 

“He could have faked it; it would certainly explain the 
blood.” 

“So what then? Dave is alive and stuffing people into 
spring-lock suits and killing them?” 

“If | could just go back to the restaurant one more time, 
to make sure that—” Charlie stopped, suddenly aware of 
growing anger in John’s face. 

“To make sure that what?” he asked sternly. 

“Nothing. Clay has it under control. Everything is best left 
with the police.” She clenched her jaw, gazing out over the 
horizon. 

Jessica will go with me. 

“Right,” John said with a surprised look. “Right, you’re 
right.” 

Charlie nodded with forced enthusiasm. 

“Clay has men for this sort of thing,” she continued with 
a furrowed brow. “I’m sure they’re on top of it.” 

John took Charlie’s shoulders lightly. “I’m sure it’s not 
what you think it is, anyway,” he said in a hearty, reassuring 
tone. “There’s a lot of crime in this world that doesn’t 
involve self-imploding furry robot suits.” He laughed and 
Charlie forced a smile. 

“Come on.” John extended a hand and Charlie took it. “I'll 
walk you to your dorm.” 

“| appreciate the gesture,” she said. “But Jessica’s there, 
and we’d have to go through the whole reunion, you know?” 


John laughed. “Okay, I'll save you from Jessica and her 
relentless camaraderie.” 

Charlie grinned. “My hero. Where are you staying, 
anyway?” 

“That little motel you stayed at last year, actually,” John 
said. “I'll see you tomorrow maybe?” 

Charlie nodded and watched him go, then started on her 
own way home. Excruciating though the date had been, the 
last half hour felt like a homecoming. It was her and John 
again; they were familiar again. “All we needed was a good 
old-fashioned murder,” she said aloud, and a woman 
walking her dog gave Charlie an odd look as she passed in 
the opposite direction. “I was at a movie, Zombies vs. 
Zombies!” Charlie called halfheartedly after her retreating 
back. “You should go check it out! They don’t put mines 
around the bunker; spoiler alert.” 

Charlie had half hoped Jessica would be asleep, but the 
lights were on when she reached their room. She flung open 
the door before Charlie had her key out of her pocket, her 
face flushed. 

“So?” Jessica demanded. 

“So what?” Charlie asked, grinning in spite of herself. 
“Hey, before you start into this, | need to ask you 
something.” 

“So you know what!” Jessica cried, ignoring her question. 
“Tell me about John. How did it go?” 

Charlie felt the corner of her mouth twitch. “Oh, you 
know,” she said casually. “Listen, | need you to go 
somewhere with me in the morning.” 

“Charlieee! You have to tell me!” Jessica moaned 
exaggeratedly, and flopped back on her bed. Then she 


sprang back up into a sitting position. “Come here and tell 
me!” Charlie sat, drawing her legs up under her. 

“It was weird,” she admitted. “I didn’t Know what to Say. 
Dates just seem so ... uncomfortable. But about what | was 
saying—” 

“But it’s John. Shouldn’t that outweigh the ‘date’ part?” 

“Well, it didn’t,” Charlie said. She looked at the floor. She 
could tell her face was red, and suddenly she wished she 
hadn’t told Jessica anything at all. 

Jessica put her hands on Charlie’s shoulders and looked 
at her seriously. “You are amazing, and if John isn’t just 
falling all over himself for you, that’s his problem.” 

Charlie giggled. “I think he kind of is. It’s part of the 
problem. But there is something else if you would just listen 
for a second.” 

“Oh, there’s more?” Jessica laughed. “Charlie! You need 
to save something for the second date, you know.” 

“What? No, no. NO! | need you to go somewhere with me 
in the morning.” 

“Charlie | have a lot going on right now; | have exams 
coming up, and ...” 

“| need you ...” Charlie clenched her jaw for a moment. “1 
need you to help me pick out new clothes for my next date,” 
she said carefully, then waited to see if Jessica would 
believe a word of it. 

“Charlie are you kidding me? We'll go first thing in the 
morning!” She jumped up and gave Charlie a giant hug. 
“We'll have a girls’ day out! It will be amazing!” Jessica 
flopped back to her bed. “Sleep for now, though.” 

“It won’t bother you if | work on my project for a while, 
will it?” 

“Not at all.” Jessica waved limply, then went still. 


* OK OX 


Charlie turned on her work lamp: a single, bright beam that 
was focused enough to not illuminate the whole room. She 
uncovered the faces; they were at rest, their features 
smooth as if in sleep, but she didn’t turn them on yet. The 
switches that made them move and talk were only one part 
of the whole. There was another component: the part that 
made them listen was always on. Everything that she and 
Jessica said, every word spoken in the room, outside the 
window, or even in the hall, they heard. Each new word 
went into their databases, not only as a single word, but in 
all its configurations as they emerged. Each new piece of 
information was stuck to the piece of information most like 
it; everything new was built on something old. They were 
always learning. 

Charlie turned on the component that allowed them to 
speak. Their features rippled softly, as if they were 
stretching themselves. 

| know, said the first, more quickly than usual. 

So what? said the second. 

Know what? 

You know so what? 

Know what? 

Now what? 

What now? 

Know how? 

Why now? 

Charlie switched them off, staring as the fans slowed to a 
stop. That didn’t make sense. She looked at her watch. It 
was about three hours too late for bed. She changed quickly 
and climbed under the sheets, leaving the faces uncovered. 


There was something unnerving about their exchange. It 
was faster than it had ever been, and it was nonsensical, 
but there was something about it that rang familiar—it 
struck her. 

“Were you playing a game?” she asked. They couldn’t 
answer, and just stared blankly into each other’s eyes. 





She removed the pillowcase gently, taking care not to let it 
catch on anything. Beneath their shroud, the faces, blank 
and sightless, were placid; they looked like they could wait, 
ever listening, for eternity. Charlie switched them on, and 
bent over to watch as they began to move their plastic 
mouths without sound, practicing. 

Where? said the first. 

Here, said the second. 

Where? said the first again. Charlie drew back. 
Something was wrong with the voice; it sounded strained. 

Here, repeated the second. 

Where? said the first with a rising intonation, like it was 
growing upset. 

That’s not supposed to happen! Charlie thought, 
alarmed. They shouldn’t be able to modulate their voices. 


Where? the first wailed, and Charlie stepped back. She 
leaned down slowly to peer under the desk, as though she 
might find an entanglement of wires that would explain the 
strange behavior. As she stared, puzzled, a baby began to 
cry. She stood at once, knocking her head painfully on the 
edge of the desk. The two faces looked suddenly more 
human, and more childlike. One was crying, the other 
watching with an astonished look on its face. “It’s okay,” 
said the calmer face. “Don’t leave me!” The other wailed as 
it turned to look at Charlie. 

“I’m not going to leave you!” Charlie cried. “Everything 
will be okay!” The sound of crying swelled, higher and 
louder than human voices should be, and Charlie covered 
her ears, looking desperately around for someone to help. 
Her bedroom had darkened, and heavy things hung from the 
ceiling. Matted fur brushed her face, and her heart jolted: 
the children are not safe. She turned back, but an acre of 
fabric and fur had somehow fallen between her and the 
wailing babies. 

“l’ll find you!” She shoved her way through, tripping on 
limbs that dragged on the ground. The costumes swung 
wildly, like trees in a storm, and a little distance away, 
something fell to the floor with a hard clunk. At last, she 
reached her desk, but they were gone. The howling went on 
and on, so loud Charlie couldn’t hear herself think, even as 
she realized that the screaming was her own. 

Charlie sat up with a loud, raw gasp, as if she had 
actually been screaming. 

“Charlie?” It was John’s voice. Charlie looked around with 
one bleary eye to see a head peering through the bedroom 
door. 


“Give mea minute!” Charlie called as she sat up straight. 
“Get out!” she cried, and John’s head shrank back; the door 
closed. She felt shaky, her muscles weak. She’d been 
holding them tense in her sleep. She changed quickly into 
clean clothes and tried to brush her slightly tangled hair into 
something more manageable, then opened the door. 

John poked his head in again, taking a cautious look 
around. 

“Okay, come in. It’s not booby-trapped, though maybe it 
should be,” Charlie joked. “How did you get in here?” 

“Well, it was open, and |...” John trailed off as he took in 
the room around him, momentarily distracted by the mess. 
“| thought maybe we could go to breakfast? | have to work 
across town in about forty minutes, but | have some time.” 

“Oh, what a nice thought, but |... ,” she said. “Sorry for 
the mess. It’s my project, | sort of get wrapped up in it and 
forget to—clean.” She glanced at her desk. The pillowcase 
was in place as it should be, the vague outlines of the faces 
just visible beneath it. /t was just a dream. 

John shrugged. “Yeah? What’s the project?” 

“Um, language. Sort of.” She looked around the room 
curiously. Where had Jessica wandered off to? Charlie knew 
John would be suspicious of her sudden, unprecedented 
interest in clothes shopping, and was hoping to avoid 
explanations. “Natural language programming,” she went 
on. “I’m taking ... computer programming classes.” At the 
last moment, something stopped her from saying the word 
robotics. John nodded. He was still eyeing the mess, and 
Charlie couldn’t tell what had caught his attention. She 
plunged back into her explanation. “So, I’m working on 
teaching language—spoken language—to computers.” She 
walked briskly to the door and peered out into the hall. 


“Don’t computers already know language?” John called. 
“Well, yeah,” Charlie said as she returned to the room. 
She looked at John. His face had changed, stripped down to 
something more adult. But she could still see him as he’d 

been the year before, captivated as he watched her old 
mechanical toys. / can tell him. 

But then a look of alarm crossed John’s face. He surged 
forward to her bed, stopping a few inches from it. He 
pointed. 

“Is that Theodore’s head?” he asked carefully. 

“Yeah,” Charlie said. She walked to the windows and 
peeped through the blinds, trying to spot Jessica’s car. 

“So you have been to the house?” 

“No. Well, yeah. | went back once,” she confessed. “To 
get him.” She looked back at John guiltily. 

He shook his head. “Charlie, you don’t have to explain 
yourself,” he said. “It’s your house.” He grabbed the chair 
from her desk and sat down. “Why did you take him apart?” 

She studied his face worriedly, wondering if he was 
already asking himself the next, obvious question: What if it 
runs in the family? 

“! wanted to see how he worked,” Charlie said. She spoke 
carefully, feeling like she had to appear as rational as 
possible. “| would have taken Stanley and Ella, too, but, you 
know.” 

“They’re bolted to the floor?” 

“Pretty much, yeah. So | took Theodore; I’m actually 
using some of his components in my project.” Charlie looked 
down at the disembodied bunny’s head, into its blank glass 
eyes. Took him apart. Using his component parts. That 
sounds rational. 


She had gotten Theodore from her father’s house just 
before school began. Jessica hadn’t been home. It was early 
evening, not quite dark, and Charlie had smuggled 
Theodore inside her backpack. She took him out, set him on 
the bed, and pressed the button to make him talk. As 
before, there was nothing but a strangled sound: “—ou— 
lie,” the scrambled, decayed traces of her father’s voice. 
Charlie had felt a pang of anger at herself for even trying. 

“You sound pretty awful,” she said harshly to Theodore, 
who just looked up at her blankly, immune to the reprimand. 
Charlie rifled through her bag of tools and parts, which 
hadn’t yet taken over her side of the room. She found her 
utility knife, then went grimly to her bed where the bunny 
waited. 

“I'll put you back together when I’m done.” Right. 

She looked up at John now, saw the doubt on his face. Or 
maybe it was concern, just like Jessica. “Sorry, | know 
everything’s a mess,” she said, hearing the edge in her own 
voice. “Maybe I’m a mess, too,” she added quietly. She set 
the bunny’s head down on her pillow, and the part of his leg 
beside it. “So, do you still want to see my project?” she 
asked. 

“Yes.” He smiled reassuringly and followed her to her 
desk. Charlie hesitated, looking down at the pillowcase. /ust 
a dream. 

“So,” she said nervously. Charlie carefully switched 
everything on before unveiling the faces. Lights began to 
blink and fans began to whir. She glanced at John again, and 
took off the cloth. 

The faces moved in little patterns, as if stretching out 
after waking, though there was little they could stretch. 
Charlie swallowed nervously. 


You, me, said the first one, and Charlie heard John make 
a surprised sound behind her. 

Me, said the second. Charlie held her breath, but they fell 
silent. 

“Sorry, they usually say more,” Charlie said. She grabbed 
a small object from the table and held it up: it was an oddly 
Shaped piece of clear plastic with wiring inside. John 
frowned for a moment. 

“Is that a hearing aid?” he asked, and Charlie nodded 
enthusiastically. 

“It used to be. It’s something I’m experimenting with: 
they listen all the time, they pick up everything that’s said 
around them, but they’re just collecting data, not interacting 
with it. They can only interact with each other.” She paused, 
waiting for a sign that John understood. He nodded, and she 
went on. “I’m still working out the kinks, but this thing 
Should make the person wearing it ... visible to them. Not 
literally visible, | mean—they can’t see—but they'll 
recognize the person wearing the device as one of them.” 
She looked expectantly at John. 

“Why ... What does that mean?” he asked, seeming to 
search for words. Charlie closed her hand on the earpiece, 
frustrated. He doesn’t understand. 

“| made them. | want to interact with them,” she said. His 
expression grew thoughtful, and she looked away, suddenly 
regretting having shown him the object. “Anyway, it’s not 
really finished.” She edged to the door and glanced out. 

“It’s really cool,” John called after her. When Charlie 
returned from the hallway, he gave her an odd look. “Is 
everything okay?” 

“Yes. You should go, though. You'll be late for work.” 
Charlie approached the faces. She looked down thoughtfully 


at her creations, then sighed and reached for the pillowcase 
to cover them. As she did, the second face moved. 

It jerked back on its stand and pivoted, locking its blind 
eyes on Charlie’s. She stared back. It was like looking ata 
statue; the eyes were only raised bumps in the molded 
plastic. But Charlie swallowed hard, feeling herself rooted to 
the spot. She studied the blank gaze until John put a hand 
on her shoulder. She jumped, startling him as well, then 
looked down at the earpiece in her hand. “Oh, right,” Charlie 
mumbled, and pressed the tiny power button on the side of 
it. She placed the earpiece carefully on top of the mess in 
her desk drawer, then closed the drawer. The face was still 
for a moment, then it slowly turned back to its place. It 
settled there, locked in a mirrored stare with its double, as if 
it had never moved at all. Charlie covered them and 
switched them off, leaving them with only enough power to 
listen. 

At last she looked up at John. “Sorry!” she said. 

“Does that mean no to breakfast?” 

“| have plans this morning,” Charlie said. “Me and 
Jessica. You know, girl stuff.” 

“Really?” John said quietly. “Girl stuff? You?” 

“Yes! Girl stuff!” Jessica squealed as she entered the 
room excitedly. “Shopping; | finally convinced Charlie it’s 
worth trying on her clothes before she buys them. We might 
even move past jeans and boots! Are you ready?” 

“Ready!” Charlie smiled, and John squinted at her. 

Jessica began escorting him gently out the door. “Right,” 
John said. “I'll see you later then, Charlie?” Charlie didn’t 
respond, but Jessica gave a bright smile as she closed the 
door behind him. 


“So.” Jessica clasped her hands. “Where do you want to 
start today?” 


* OK OX 


When they got to the parking lot of the abandoned mall, it 
was early afternoon. 

“Charlie, this isn’t what | had in mind,” Jessica cried as 
they got out of the car. Charlie started for the entrance, but 
Jessica didn’t follow. When Charlie turned, she was leaning 
against the car with her arms crossed. 

“What are we doing here?” Jessica asked, her eyebrows 
raised. 

“We have to look inside,” Charlie said. “People’s lives 
might depend on it. | just want to see if there is anything left 
of Freddy’s, then we can go.” 

“Whose lives depend on it? And why now, suddenly?” 
Jessica asked. 

Charlie looked at her shoes. “I just want to see,” she 
said. She felt like a petulant child, but she couldn’t bring 
herself to tell Jessica the whole story. 

“Is this because John is here?” Jessica asked suddenly, 
and Charlie looked up, surprised. 

“What? No.” 

Jessica sighed and uncrossed her arms. “It’s okay, 
Charlie. | get it. You haven’t seen him since all of this 
happened, and then he shows up again—of course it brings 
everything back.” 

Charlie nodded, gratefully latching on to this rationale. It 
was easier than hiding the truth from her. “I doubt there’s 
much left, anyway,” she said. “I just want to walk through 
and remind myself that—” 


“That it’s really over?” Jessica finished. She smiled, and 
Charlie’s heart sank. 

It’s really, really not over. She forced a smile. “Something 
like that.” 

Charlie walked quickly through the mall, but Jessica 
lagged behind. The place felt entirely different. Sunlight 
poured in through massive gaps in the unfinished walls and 
ceiling. Shafts of light sifted between smaller cracks and 
splashed against stacks of concrete slabs. Charlie could see 
moths—maybe butterflies—hovering at the windows, and as 
they passed through the empty halls on their way to 
Freddy’s, she could hear birds chirping. The deathly quiet 
she remembered, the overpowering sense of dread, was 
gone. Yet, Charlie thought as she glanced at the half- 
constructed storefronts, it still felt haunted, maybe even 
more than before. It was a different kind of haunting, not 
frightening. But Charlie had the sense that something was 
present, like stepping onto hallowed ground. 

“Hello,” Charlie said softly, not sure whom she was 
addressing. 

“Do you hear something?” Jessica slowed her pace. 

“No. It feels smaller.” Charlie gestured at the open 
mouths of the never-opened department stores, and the end 
of the hall ahead of them. “It seemed so intimidating last 
time.” 

“It actually seems kind of peaceful.” Jessica spun in 
place, enjoying the air from outside, which was flowing 
freely through the empty spaces. 

Jessica followed Charlie through the doorway and they 
stopped dead, blinded by bright sunlight. Freddy’s had been 
torn apart. Some of the walls still stood—the far end looked 


almost intact—but in front of her was a field of debris. Old 
bricks and broken tiles were strewn in the dirt. 

The two of them stood now on a slab of concrete that lay 
baking in the sun. The passage inward, along with the entire 
side wall of the restaurant, was gone. The walls and ceiling 
were just a line of rubble against the trees. The concrete 
walkway was still there, worn dark by years of dank and 
leaking pipes. 

“So much for Freddy’s,” Jessica said in a hushed voice, 
and Charlie nodded. 

They made their way through the debris. Charlie could 
make out where the main dining room had been, but 
everything was gone. The tables and chairs, the checkered 
cloths, and the party hats had all been removed. The merry- 
go-round had been ripped out, leaving nothing but a hole in 
the floor and some stray wires. The stage itself had been 
assaulted, though not removed. They must have been in the 
middle of that when the job was stopped. Boards were torn 
up across the main stage area, and the left-hand set of 
stairs was gone. What was left of the wall behind the stage 
broke off at the top, like jagged mountains along the sky. 

“Are you Okay?” Jessica looked to Charlie. 

“Yeah. It’s not what | expected, but I’m okay.” She 
thought for a moment. “I want to see what’s still here.” 
Charlie gestured to the stage, and they crossed what was 
left of the dining area. The floorboards cracked, the linoleum 
torn. Jessica peered under a pile of rock where arcade 
machines had been. The consoles that had stood like dusty 
gravestones were gone, but they could see the outlines of 
each one. Square patches remained where they’d been torn 
from their posts. Stray wires huddled in small piles in the 
corners. Charlie turned her attention back to the main 


stage. She climbed up to where the animatronic animals 
had once performed. 

“Careful!” Jessica cried. Charlie nodded an absent 
acknowledgment. She stood to one side, remembering the 
layout. This is where Freddy stood. The boards were torn up 
in front of her and in two more places—the destruction here 
was where they had taken out the pivoting plates that 
bolted the mascots to the stage. Not that they stayed bolted 
very long, Charlie thought wryly. She could see it now if she 
closed her eyes. The animals were going through their 
programmed motions, faster and faster, until it was clear 
they were out of control. Moving wildly, as if they were 
afraid. They were rocking on their stands, and then the 
awful sound of cracking wood as Bonnie lifted his bolted foot 
and tore himself free of the stage. 

Charlie shook her head, trying to rid herself of the image. 
She made her way to the back of the stage. The lights were 
all gone, but a skeleton of exposed beams crisscrossed the 
open sky where the lights had been. 

“Jessica!” she called. “Where are you?” 

“Down here!” 

She followed the sound of the girl’s voice. Jessica was 
crouched in the place where the control room had been, 
peering into the gap under the stage. 

“Nothing?” Charlie asked, not sure what answer she was 
hoping for. 

“It’s been gutted,” Jessica said. “No monitors, nothing.” 
Charlie climbed down beside her, and they peered in 
together. 

“This is where we were trapped last time,” Jessica said 
quietly. “Me and John; there was something at the door, and 
the lock caught. | thought we would be stuck in that little 


room and ...” She looked at Charlie, who simply nodded. The 
horrors of that night were unique to each of them. The 
moments that beset them in their sleep, or assailed their 
thoughts without warning in the middle of the day, were 
private. 

“Come on,” Charlie said abruptly, heading again toward 
the mound of rubble where more games had been. Charlie 
crouched under a large slab that leaned to the side and 
acted as a doorway to what was left of the place. 

“This seems dangerous.” Jessica tiptoed over the loose 
rock. 

The floor was still covered in carpet in most places, and 
Charlie could see the deep grooves where the arcade 
machine had been. She hurled herself at the console, and 
somehow, it was enough. It wobbled on its base, then fell, 
knocking Foxy to the ground and pinning him there. She ran, 
but he was too quick: he caught her by the leg and ripped 
his hook right through her; she screamed, staring down at 
the snapping, twisted metal jaws, and the burning, silver 
eyes. She heard a noise, almost a whimper, and realized it 
was her. She clapped her hands over her mouth. 

“| thought we were all going to die,” Jessica whispered. 
“Me too,” Charlie said. They looked at each other for a 
moment, an eerie stillness settling over the sunlit wreckage. 

“Hey, this place is probably going to fall on us soon, so 
...” Jessica broke the silence, gesturing to the leaning slabs 
of concrete surrounding them. Charlie crawled back out the 
way they’d come and stood up. Her knees were crawling 
with pins and needles. She rubbed them, then stomped the 
ground. 

“| want to check the costume room, see if anything is 
left,” Charlie said without expression. 


“You mean to see if anybody is left?” Jessica shook her 
head. 

“| have to know.” Charlie gave her jeans a final brush and 
started off toward it. 

The room stuck out of the rubble, alone and intact. It was 
the place where the costumes had been kept, and where 
Carlton had briefly been held prisoner. Charlie cautiously 
poked her head inside, studying the physical details around 
her: the chipped paint on the wall, the carpet that someone 
had begun to tear up but left unfinished. Don’t think about 
last time. Don’t think about what happened here. She let 
her eyes adjust a moment longer, then went inside. 

The room was empty. They did a cursory search, but 
everything had been removed—there was nothing left but 
walls, floor, and ceiling. 

“Clay did say they had gotten rid of everything,” Charlie 
said. 

Jessica gave her a sharp look. “Clay? When?” 

“He said he was going to, | mean,” Charlie said hastily, 
covering the slip. “Last year.” 

They took a final look around. As they were leaving, 
Charlie spotted a glint of light from something in the corner. 
It was the plastic eyeball of some unknown animatronic 
mascot. Charlie was about to go to it, but stopped herself. 
“There’s nothing here,” she said. 

Not waiting for Jessica, she headed back through the 
debris, looking down at her feet as she stepped over bricks 
and stones and shattered glass. 

“Hey, wait,” Jessica called after her hastily. “Pirate’s 
Cove. Charlie! Look!” Charlie stopped. She watched Jessica 
as she climbed over a steel beam and stepped carefully 
over the remains of a fallen wall. In front of her, a curtain lay 


strewn across what had appeared to be a pile of rubble. 
Charlie followed her, and when she caught up she could see 
that the curtain concealed a gap in the ruins. The tops of a 
few glittering chairs peeked out from the stones. A row of 
broken stage lights lay across the top of the curtain, as 
though holding it in place. 

“It looks pretty good, compared to the rest of the place,” 
Jessica said. Charlie didn’t answer. There was a dirty poster 
lying flat on the ground, depicting a cartoonish Foxy 
delivering pizzas to happy children. 

“Jessica, look.” Charlie pointed to the ground. 

“Those look like claw marks,” Jessica said after a 
moment. 

There were long scratches and scrapes running the 
length of the floor, and dark marks that looked like traces of 
blood. “It’s like someone was being dragged.” Jessica stood 
and followed the scratches. They led behind the curtain, 
away from the area where Pirate’s Cove once stood. 

“The stage,” Jessica said. 

When they moved the curtain aside, they found the 
stage had a small hatch at the back. “Storage,” Charlie 
murmured. She pulled on it, but the hatch wouldn’t open. 

“There has to be a latch somewhere,” Jessica said. She 
cleared away dirt and broken wood from the base of the 
stage, uncovering a deadbolt that went into the floor. She 
pulled it up, releasing the door, which swung open like 
something was pushing against it. 

A face lurched out of the darkness, two gaping eyes 
swinging forward. Jessica screamed and fell backward. 
Charlie recoiled. The masked face hung lifelessly from a 
rotted fur costume. An entire mascot suit was inside, 
crammed into a space much too small for it. Charlie 


stopped, her whole body numb with shock as she stared at 
the thing with a dread almost as old as she was. “The yellow 
rabbit,” she whispered. 

“It’s Dave,” Jessica gasped. Charlie took a deep breath, 
forcing herself back into the present. 

“Come on, help me,” she said She stepped forward and 
grabbed at the fabric, pulling on whatever she could reach. 

“You're kidding. I’m not touching that thing.” 

“Jessica! Get over here!” Charlie commanded, and 
Jessica came reluctantly over. 

“Ew, ew, ew.” Jessica touched the suit, then recoiled. She 
gave Charlie a flat look and tried again, yanking her hands 
away as soon as she touched it. “Ew,” she repeated quietly, 
then finally screwed her eyes shut and took hold of it. 

Together they pulled, but nothing happened. “I think it’s 
stuck,” Jessica said. They shifted positions and finally 
heaved the mascot out of the cramped space. The fabric 
caught on stray nails and jagged wood, but Charlie kept 
pulling. At last the creature was out, splayed heavily on the 
ground. 

“| definitely don’t think Dave faked his own death,” 
Charlie said. 

“What if it’s not him?” Jessica peered carefully into the 
face. 

“It’s him.” Charlie looked at the dried blood soaked into 
the mascot’s fingertips. “The spring locks might not have 
killed him right away, but this is where he died.” 

They could see Dave’s body through the gaps in the 
costume, and the wide carved eyes of the mascot head 
showed through to his face. His skin was desiccated and 
shriveled. His eyes were wide open, his face expressionless 
and discolored. Charlie moved closer again. Her initial shock 


had passed, and now she was curious to see more of him. 
She probed carefully at first, in case some of the spring 
locks inside might still be waiting to snap, but it was clear 
that they’d already done their damage. The locks had been 
driven so deeply into his skin that the bases of each were 
flush against his neck; they looked like part of him. 

Charlie studied the chest of the costume. There were 
large tears in the yellow fabric, which had gone green and 
pink with mold in patches. She grabbed hold of the sides 
and pulled the gap open as wide as she could. Jessica 
watched, fascinated, her hand over her mouth. Skewers of 
metal protruded through his entire body, dull and crusted 
with his blood. And there were more complex parts, twisted 
knots of gore with many layers of machinery that stuck out 
from his body. The suit’s fabric was stiff with blood, too, yet 
the man didn’t seem to have rotted, despite the year that 
had passed. 

“It’s like he’s fused with the suit,” Charlie said. She 
tugged at the mascot head, trying to pull it off, but gave up 
quickly. The gaping eyes stared up at her, behind which was 
the dead man’s face. With the light directly on him, Dave’s 
Skin appeared sickly and discolored. Charlie felt a sudden 
rush of nausea. She pulled back from the corpse and looked 
up at Jessica. 

“So now what?” Jessica said. “Did you want to give hima 
foot massage, too?” She abruptly turned her head away, 
gagging at her own joke. 

“Listen, | have class in...” Charlie checked her watch. 
“About an hour. Did you still want to do some shopping?” 

“Why can’t | have normal friends?” Jessica groaned. 





We are learning all the time. Hopefully at least some of you 
are learning right here in this class.” Dr. Treadwell’s students 
laughed nervously, but she continued over them; it had 
apparently not been a joke. “When we learn, our minds 
must decide where we will store that information. 
Unconsciously we determine what group of things it is most 
relevant to and connect it to that group. This is, of course, 
only the most rudimentary explanation. When computers do 
this, we call it an information tree ...” 

Charlie was only half listening; she knew this already and 
was taking her notes on autopilot. Since their expedition to 
Freddy’s the day before, she hadn’t been able to get the 
image of Dave’s body out of her head: his torso and the 
gruesome lace of scars that had covered it. When he was 
alive, he’d shown them off to her, boasting of his survival. 


While he never told her what had happened, it must have 
been an accident. He used to wear those suits all the time. 
She could see him now, before all the murders, dressed as a 
yellow bunny and dancing merrily with a yellow bear ... she 
shook her head suddenly, trying to get rid of the image. 

“Are you Okay?” Arty whispered. She nodded, waving him 
off. 

But the dead man in the field—that wasn’t an accident. 
Someone forced him inside. But why? Charlie restlessly 
tapped her fingers on her desk. 

“That will be all for today.” Dr. Treadwell set down her 
chalk and stalked off the auditorium stage with a purposeful 
step. Her teaching assistant, a flustered graduate student, 
scurried forward to collect the homework. 

“Hey, do you have any time to go over some of this?” 
Arty asked Charlie as they gathered up their things. “I’m in 
a little bit over my head in this class.” 

Charlie paused. She’d promised to make up her first date 
with John, but she wasn’t meeting him for over an hour. Now 
that she’d been to Freddy’s, Charlie almost felt like she was 
on familiar ground, even if it was soaked in blood. 

“| have some time now,” she told Arty, who lit up. 

“Great! Thanks so much, we can go work over at the 
library.” 

Charlie nodded. “Sure.” She followed him across the 
Campus, only half engaged as he explained his difficulties 
with the material. 

They found a table, and Charlie opened her notebook to 
the pages she’d taken down today, pushing them across so 
Arty could see them. 

“Actually, do you mind if | sit next to you?” he asked. “It’s 
easier if we’re both looking at the same thing, right?” 


“Oh, yeah.” Charlie pulled her notes back over as he 
Came around and sat next to her, scooting his metal folding 
chair next to hers, just a few inches closer than she would 
have preferred. “So, where did you get lost?” she asked him. 

“| was telling you on the way over,” he said, with a hint 
of reproach in his voice, then cleared his throat. “I guess | 
understood the beginning of the lecture, when she was 
reviewing last week’s material.” 

Charlie laughed. “So, basically you want to review 
everything new from today.” 

Arty nodded sheepishly. Charlie started from the 
beginning, pointing at her notes as she went. As she flipped 
through the pages, she noticed her own scribbles in the 
margins. Charlie leaned in closer, where harsh outlines of 
rectangles lined the bottom of the page. They were all 
colored in, like slabs of granite. She stared at them with a 
sensation of déja vu: they were important. / don’t remember 
drawing that, she thought uneasily. Then, /t’s just doodles. 
Everybody doodles. 

She turned the page to the next segment of the lecture, 
and a strange alertness rose at the base of her neck, as if 
someone might be watching her. There were more doodles 
in the margins of this page, too, and the next one. All of 
them were rectangles. Some were large and some were 
small, some scribbled and some outlined in so solidly that 
her pen had wet the paper through and torn it. All of them 
were vertical, taller than they were wide. Charlie stared, 
tilting her head to see from different angles, until something 
pinged inside her. 

Sammy, she thought, then, /s this you? Does this mean 
something | don’t understand? Charlie glanced at Arty; he 
was Staring at the paper, too. As she watched, he turned the 


page again. The next pages were the same. They were filled 
with neat, clear notes, but little rectangles were squashed 
into every available spot on the page: stuffed into the space 
between bullet points, crammed into the margins, and 
tucked away where lines came up short. Quickly, Arty 
flipped the page back. He looked up at her and smiled, but 
his eyes were wary. 

“Why don’t you try the first problem here?” Charlie 
suggested. 

Arty bent over his worksheet, and Charlie stared down at 
her notebook. Her mind kept returning to her father’s house, 
and the shapes she’d drawn only made the impulse 
stronger. 

| have to go back. 

“Are you Okay?” Arty leaned in cautiously. Charlie stared 
down at her notebook. Now that she’d noticed the 
rectangles, they seemed more prominent than the notes; 
she could focus on nothing else. / have to go back. 

Charlie shut the notebook and blinked hard. She ignored 
Arty’s question, shoving the notebook into her backpack. 

“| have to go,” she said as she stood up. 

“But I’m still stuck on the first problem,” Arty said. 

“I’m sorry, | really am!” she called over her shoulder as 
she hurried away. She bumped into two people as she 
passed the circulation desk but was too flustered to mutter 
an apology. 

When she got to the door, she stopped, her guts twisting. 
There’s something wrong. She hesitated, her hand 
Suspended in the air, as if something was blocking her path. 
She finally took hold of the knob, and instantly her hand felt 
fused to it, as if by an electrical current. She couldn’t turn it, 
and she couldn’t let go. Suddenly, the knob moved on its 


own; someone was turning it from the other side. Charlie 
yanked her hand away and stepped back as a boy with an 
enormous backpack brushed past her. Snapping back into 
the moment, she slipped out before the door could swing 
shut again.

Charlie soed toward Hurricane, trying to calm herself as she 
drove. The windows were cracked open and wind was 
rushing in. She thought back to Treadwell’s lecture earlier in 
the week. At every moment, your senses are receiving far 
more information than they can process all at once. Maybe 
that was Arty’s problem in class. Charlie gazed at the 
mountains ahead, the open fields on either side. Watching 
them go by, she began to feel like some restraint had been 
loosened. She’d been spending too much time in her room 
or in class, and not enough out in the world. It was making 
her jumpy, exaggerating her natural awkwardness. 

She rolled her window down farther, letting in the air. 
Over the field to her right a few birds were circling—no. 
Charlie stopped the car. Something is wrong. She got out, 
feeling ridiculous, but the last few days had put her ona 
hair trigger. The birds were too large. 

She realized they were turkey vultures, and some of 
them were already on the ground, cautiously approaching 
what looked like a prone figure. Could be anything. She 
leaned against the car. Probably just a dead animal. After 
another moment, she turned back toward her car in 
frustration, but didn’t get in. 

It’s not a dead animal. 


She clenched her teeth and started to the spot the 
vultures were circling. As she got closer, the birds on the 
ground flapped their wings at the sight of her and soared 
away. Charlie dropped to her knees. 

It was a woman. Charlie’s eyes went first to her clothing. 
It was ripped up, just like the dead man Clay Burke had 
Shown her. 

She leaned over to check the woman’s neck, though she 
knew what she would find. There were deep, ugly gouges 
from the spring locks of an animatronic suit. But before she 
could examine them closely, Charlie stopped, horrified. 

She looks just like me. The woman’s face was bruised 
and scratched, which obscured her features. Charlie shook 
her head. It was easier to imagine more of a resemblance 
than there really was. But her hair was brown and cut like 
Charlie’s, and her face was the same round shape, with the 
Same complexion. Her features were different, but not that 
different. Charlie stood up and took a deliberate step back 
from the woman, suddenly aware of how exposed she was 
in the open field. Clay. | need to call Clay. She looked up at 
the sky, wishing for a way to keep the vultures at bay, to 
protect the body. “I’m sorry,” she whispered to the dead 
woman. “I'll be back.” 

Charlie started off to her car, then broke into a run, faster 
and faster across the field until she ran like something was 
right behind her. She got in and slammed the door, locking 
it as soon as she was inside. 

Panting heavily, Charlie thought for a second. She was 
about halfway between Hurricane and the school, but there 
was a gas Station just down the road where she could call 
Clay. With a last glance at the spot where the body lay, 
Charlie pulled out onto the road. 


* OK OX 


The gas station seemed to be empty. As she arrived, Charlie 
realized that she had never actually seen anyone fueling up 
here. /s this a working gas station? The place was old and 
Shabby, which she had noticed in passing, but she’d never 
stopped to look around. The pumps looked functional, 
though not new, and there was no shelter above them. They 
simply stood on concrete blocks in the middle of a gravel 
driveway, exposed to the weather. 

The little building attached to the station might have 
been painted white once, but the paint had worn down to 
reveal gray boards underneath. It seemed to be tilting 
Slightly, slipping on its foundation. There was a window, but 
it was filthy, almost the same color gray as the building’s 
outside walls. Charlie hesitated, then went to the door and 
knocked. A young man answered, about Charlie’s age, 
wearing a St. John’s College T-shirt and jeans. 

“Yeah?” he said, giving her a blank stare. 

“Are you—open?” 

“Yeah.” He was chewing gum and wiped his hands ona 
grimy rag. Charlie took a deep breath. 

“| really need to use your phone.” The boy opened the 
door and let her in. There was more space inside than she’d 
thought. In addition to the counter, there was a convenience 
store, though most of the shelves were empty and the line 
of refrigerators at the back was dark. The young man was 
looking at Charlie expectantly. 

“Can | use your phone?” she asked again. 

“Phone’s for customers only,” he said. 

“Okay.” Charlie glanced back at her car. “I’ll get gas on 
the way out.” 


“Pump’s broken; maybe you want something out of the 
cooler,” he said, nodding at a grimy freezer with a sliding 
glass top and a faded patch of red paint that must once 
have been a logo. “We've got Popsicles.” 

“| don’t want—fine, I'll take a Popsicle,” Charlie said. 

“Pick out any one you want.” 

Charlie leaned into the cooler. 

Pale, glassy eyes stared back at her. Beneath them was a 
furry red muzzle, its mouth open and poised to snap. 

Charlie screamed and hurtled backward, banging into the 
Shelf behind her. Several cans fell off the shelf and rolled 
across the floor. The sound echoed in the empty space. 

“What is that?” Charlie yelled, but the boy was cackling 
so hard he was gasping for breath. Peering back inside, 
Charlie realized that someone had placed a taxidermic 
animal in the cooler, maybe a coyote. 

“That was great!” he finally managed to say. Charlie 
drew herself up, shaking with rage. 

“! would like to use your phone now,” she said coldly. 
The boy beckoned her to the counter, all smiles, and 
handed her a rotary phone. “No long distance, though,” he 
warned. Charlie turned her back and dialed, walking toward 
the cooler as the phone rang. She peered in the top, 

studying the stuffed canine from the high angle. 

“Clay Burke here.” 

“Clay, it’s Charlie. Listen, | need you to meet me. It’s 
another ...” She glanced at the young man behind the 
counter, who was watching her intently, not trying to hide 
the fact that he was listening. “It’s like that thing you 
showed me before, with the cows.” 

“What? Charlie, where are you?” 


“I’m at a gas station a few miles from you. Looks like 
someone painted an outhouse.” 

“Hey!” The boy behind the counter straightened for a 
moment, taking offense. 

“Right, | Know where you're at. I'll be right there.” There 
was a click from the other end. 

“Thanks for the phone,” Charlie said begrudgingly, and 
left without waiting for a reply. 


* OK OX 


Charlie crouched again where the woman’s body lay. She 
looked anxiously up the road for Clay’s car, but it didn’t 
appear. At least the vultures hadn’t returned. 

| could just stay in the car until he gets here, she 
thought. But Charlie didn’t move from her spot. This woman 
had died horribly and been abandoned in a field. Now, at 
least, she didn’t have to be alone. 

The more Charlie looked at her, the harder it was to 
dismiss the resemblance. Charlie shivered, even though the 
sun was warm on her back. She was filling with a cold, 
crawling dread. 

“Charlie?” 

Charlie soun around to see Clay Burke, then sighed and 
shook her head. 

“Sorry, | got here as fast as | could,” he said lightly. 

She smiled. “It’s okay. I’m just on edge today. | think 
that’s the third time I’ve jumped in the air when someone 
said my name.” 

Clay wasn’t listening. His eyes were fixed on the body. He 
knelt carefully beside it, scrutinizing it. Charlie could almost 


see him filing every detail away. She held her breath, not 
wanting to disturb him. 

“Did you touch the body?” he asked sharply, not looking 
away from the corpse. 

“Yes,” she admitted. “I checked to see if she had the 
same injuries as the man.” 

“Did she?” 

“Yes. | think—I know she was killed the same way.” 

Clay nodded. Charlie watched as he got up and circled 
the woman, dropping down to look more closely at her 
head, and again at her feet. Finally, he turned his attention 
to Charlie again. 

“How did you find her?” he asked. 

“| saw birds—vultures—circling above the field. | went to 
check.” 

“Why did you go to check?” His eyes were hard, and 
Charlie felt a trickle of fear. Surely Clay didn’t suspect her. 

Why wouldn’t he? she thought. Who else would know 
how to use the spring locks? | bet he could come up with a 
million theories about me. Twisted girl avenges father’s 
death. Acts out psychodrama. Film at eleven. She took a 
deep breath, meeting Clay’s eyes. 

“| checked because of the body you showed me. It was in 
a field—I thought it might be another one.” She kept her 
voice as steady as she could. Clay nodded, the steely 
expression slipping from his face, replaced by worry. 

“Charlie, this girl looks like you,” he said bluntly. 

“Not that much like me.” 

“She could be your twin,” Clay said. 

“No,” Charlie said, more harshly than she intended. “She 
looks nothing like my twin.” Clay gave her a puzzled look, 
then comprehension dawned. 


“I’m sorry. You had a twin, didn’t you? Your brother.” 

“| barely remember him,” she said softly, then 
swallowed. A// / do is remember him. “| Know she looks like 
me,” she added weakly. 

“We're right near a college town,” Clay said. “She’s a 
young white female with brown hair—you’re not a rare type, 
Charlie. No offense.” 

“Do you think it’s a coincidence?” 

Clay didn’t look at her. “There was another body found 
this morning,” he said. 

“Another girl?” Charlie drew closer. 

“Yes, aS a matter of fact. Been dead for a couple of days, 
probably killed two nights ago.” Charlie looked down at him 
in alarm. 

“Does that mean this is going to keep happening?” 

“Unless you think we can stop it,” he said. Charlie 
nodded. 

“I can help,” she said. She looked again at the woman’s 
face. She’s nothing like me. “Let me go to her house,” she 
added abruptly, seized by a sudden impulse to prove it, to 
gather evidence that she and the victim were not the same. 

“What? Her house?” Clay said, giving her a dubious look 

“You asked me to help,” Charlie said. “Let me help.” 

Clay didn’t answer; instead he reached into the woman’s 
pockets one by one, searching for her wallet. He had to 
move the body to do it, and she jerked a little as he did, like 
a ghastly puppet. Charlie waited, and at last he came back 
with her wallet. He handed Charlie her driver’s license. 

“Tracy Horton,” she read. “She doesn’t look like a Tracy.” 

“You got the address?” Clay scanned the road for police 
cars. Charlie read it quickly and handed the license back. 


” 


“I’m going to give you twenty minutes before | radio this in, 
he told her. “Use it.” 


* OK OX 


Tracy Horton had lived in a small house off a back road. Her 
nearest neighbors’ houses were visible, but Charlie couldn’t 
imagine they would have heard her scream. If she’d 
managed to scream at all. There was a small blue car in the 
driveway, but if Tracy had been taken from her home—since 
presumably she hadn’t just been wandering through that 
field—it could easily have been hers. 

Charlie pulled in behind the car and went to the front 
door. She knocked, wondering what she was going to do if 
someone answered. / really should have thought this 
through. She couldn’t be the one to inform a parent, spouse, 
or sibling of the young woman’s death. Why did / assume 
she lived alone? 

No one answered. Charlie tried again, and when there 
was still no response, she tried the door. It was unlocked. 

Charlie walked quietly through the house, not really sure 
what she was looking for. She glanced at her watch—ten of 
the twenty minutes had passed just driving here, and she 
had to assume that the police would get here faster than 
She did. Why did | follow the speed limit the whole way 
here? The living room and kitchen were clean, but they 
conveyed no information to her. Charlie didn’t know what 
peach-painted walls said about a person, or the fact that 
there were three dining room chairs instead of four. There 
were two bedrooms. One had the sterile air of a guest room 
that was slowly being taken over by storage; the bed was 


made and clean towels were folded on the chest of drawers, 
but cardboard boxes filled a quarter of the room. 

The other bedroom looked lived-in. The walls were green, 
the bedspread pale blue, and there were piles of clothing on 
the floor. Charlie stood in the doorway for a moment, and 
found she could not go inside. / don’t even know what I’m 
looking for. This woman's life would be sifted through to the 
last grain by trained investigators. Her diary would be read, 
if she had one; her secrets would be revealed, if she had 
any. Charlie didn’t need to be a part of it. She turned and 
walked quickly but quietly back to the front of the house, 
almost running down the front steps. Standing by the car, 
she checked her watch again. Six minutes before Clay called 
in the body. 

Charlie went to the little blue car and peered inside. Like 
the house, it was neat. There was dry-cleaning hanging in 
the back window, and a half-empty soda in the cup holder. 
She walked all around it, looking for something—mud in the 
tires, scratches in the paint, but there was nothing unusual. 
Five minutes. 

She walked briskly through the unkempt grass that 
bordered the sides of the house. When she reached the 
backyard, she stopped dead. Before her were three huge 
holes in the ground, longer than they were wide. They 
looked like graves, but at a second glance they were too 
messy, their outlines poorly defined. 

Charlie walked around them in a circle. They were lined 
up next to one another, and they were shallow, but the dirt 
at the bottom was loose. Charlie grabbed a stick off the 
ground and poked it into the middle hole: it went in almost a 
foot before it was stopped by denser soil. The dirt dug out of 
them was strewn messily all around. Whoever dug the holes 


had carelessly tossed it everywhere, not bothering to pile it 
up. 

Two minutes. 

Charlie hesitated for another moment, then lowered 
herself into the middle hole. Her feet sunk into the loose dirt 
and she fought to steady herself, catching her balance. It 
wasn’t too deep. The walls came up to her waist. She knelt 
and put her palm against the wall of the grave—the hole, 
she reminded herself. The dirt was loose here, too, and the 
wall was rough. 

Something had been hidden there, under the ground. 
The air ts growing thin. |! am running out of oxygen, and | will 
die like this, alone, in the dark. Charlie’s throat seized; she 
felt as if she couldn’t breathe. She climbed out of the hole 
and up onto the grass of Tracy Horton’s backyard. Charlie 
took a deep breath, focusing all her attention on pushing 
away the panic. When she was free of it, she checked her 
watch. 

Minus one minute. He’s already called them. But 
something kept her there, something familiar. The /oose dirt. 
Charlie’s mind raced. Something climbed out of these. 

From a distance, a siren was wailing; it would be here in 
no time. Charlie hurried to her car and pulled out of the 
driveway, taking the first corner without caring where it 
would take her. The holes stayed in her mind, the image like 
a stain. 





Charlie slowed her car. With half the cops in Hurricane 
converging on the area, now was not the time to be stopped 
for soeeding. She was grubby with dirt from the dead 
woman’s backyard, and had a nagging feeling there was 
something she was forgetting about. 

John, she realized. She was supposed to meet him—she 
checked the clock on the dashboard—almost two hours ago. 
Her heart sank. He’// think | stood him up. No, he’ll think I’m 
dead, she amended. Given the perilous history of their 
relationship, he’d probably think the second was more likely. 

When she got to the restaurant where they had planned 
to meet, a small Italian place across town, Charlie ran in 
from the parking lot at full soeed. She skidded to a stop in 
front of the teenage hostess, who greeted her with a 
flustered look. 


“Can | help you?” she asked Charlie, taking a step back. 

Charlie caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror behind 
the hostess counter. There were streaks of dirt on her face 
and clothes; she hadn’t thought to clean up first. She 
quickly wiped her cheeks with her hands before answering 
the girl. 

“I’m supposed to be meeting someone. A tall guy, brown 
hair. It’s kind of ...” She gestured vaguely at the top of her 
head, attempting to indicate the habitual chaos of John’s 
hair, but the hostess looked at her blankly. Charlie bit her lip 
in frustration. He must have left. Of course he left. You’re 
two hours late. 

“Charlie?” A voice rang out. John. 

“You're still here?” she cried, too loud for the quiet 
restaurant, as he appeared behind the hostess, looking 
profoundly relieved. 

“| figured | might as well eat while I’m here.” He 
swallowed what was in his mouth and laughed. “Are you 
okay? | thought you might ... not be coming.” 

“I’m fine. Where are you sitting? Or are you still sitting? 
Well, | mean, you’re obviously not sitting. You’re standing. 
But | mean before you were standing, where were you 
sitting?” Charlie ran her fingers into her hair and clenched 
her fists against her scalp, trying to reassemble her 
thoughts. She mumbled an apology to the room, not sure 
who it was for. 

John glanced around nervously, then gestured toward a 
table near the kitchen. There was a mostly empty plate with 
a half-eaten breadstick resting on it, a cup of coffee, anda 
second place setting, untouched. 

They sat down and he looked at her appraisingly. Then 
John leaned across the table and asked in a low voice, 


“Charlie, what happened?” 

“You wouldn’t believe me if | told you?” she said lightly. 

His face remained concerned. “You're filthy. Did you fall 
down in the parking lot?” 

“Yes,” Charlie said. “I fell in the parking lot and rolled 
down a hill and into a Dumpster, then fell out of the 
Dumpster and tripped on the way in. Happy? Stop looking at 
me like that.” 

“Like what?” 

“Like you have the right to disapprove of me.” John 
pulled back in his chair, his eyes wide. He blinked hard, and 
Charlie sighed. 

“John, I’m sorry. I'll tell you everything. | just need some 
time; some time to collect my thoughts and to clean up.” 
She laughed, an exhausted, shaken sound, then buried her 
face in her hands. 

John leaned back and signaled for the waitress to bring 
the check. Breathing heavily, Charlie looked around the 
restaurant. It was almost empty. The hostess and the only 
other waitress were talking together near the door, with no 
apparent interest in anything their customers were doing. 
There was a family of four by the front window, the children 
just barely out of toddlerhood. One kept sliding out of his 
chair and onto the floor every time his mother turned her 
attention away. The other, a girl, was happily drawing on the 
tablecloth with markers. No one seemed to care what was 
going on. But the emptiness made Charlie feel exposed. 

“I’m going to go clean up,” she said. “Bathroom?” John 
pointed. 

Charlie got up and left the table just as the waitress 
arrived to deliver his ticket. There was a pay phone in the 
hallway, and Charlie stopped at it, wavering. She craned her 


neck to see if John was watching, but from where she stood, 
she could only see a tiny corner of their table. Quickly, she 
called Clay Burke’s office. 

To her surprise, he answered. “You saw her backyard,” he 
said. It wasn’t a question. 

“Can you give me the other addresses?” Charlie asked. 
“There could be a pattern—something.” 

“There sure could,” he said drily. “That’s why | raced 
back to the station instead of sticking around to measure 
the holes. You have a pen?” 

“Hang on.” The hostess was briefly absent from her 
station, and Charlie dropped the phone, letting it swing on 
its metal cord as she hurried to the podium and snatched a 
pen and a take-out menu. She rushed back. “Clay? Go 
ahead.” He recited names and addresses, and she scribbled 
them dutifully in the margins of the menu. “Thanks,” she 
said when he was done, and hung up without waiting for 
him to respond. She folded the menu and slipped it into her 
back pocket. 

In the bathroom, Charlie washed off as much of the dirt 
as she could. She couldn’t clean her clothing, but at least 
her face was scrubbed, and her hair was rearranged a little 
more neatly. 

As she moved to exit the bathroom, an image flashed 
unbidden through her thoughts. It was the face of the dead 
woman. 

She could be your twin, she heard Clay say, in his low, 
authoritative voice. 

Charlie shook her head. /t’s a coincidence. He’s right. 
How many brown-haired, college-aged women are there 
around here? The first victim was a man. It doesn’t mean 
anything. She grabbed the doorknob to leave, but froze. It 


was just like in the library. Charlie released the knob and it 
spun slowly back into position, releasing a horrible creak as 
it moved. 

The costumes had been disturbed, and the creaking 
noise was so faint and careful she scarcely even heard it. 
Charlie looked up from her game: there was a figure in the 
door. 

Charlie glanced wildly around the room, pulling herself 
back to the present. With a swell of panic, Charlie pulled on 
the bathroom door, but it had somehow sealed shut. She 
mouthed words, but no sound came out: 

| know you’re there. I’m trying to get to you. 

“| have to get inside!” she screamed. The door burst 
open, and Charlie fell into John’s arms. 

“Charlie!” 

She collapsed to her knees. Charlie looked up to see the 
scattered handful of customers all staring at her. John 
glanced into the bathroom behind her, then quickly turned 
his attention back to Charlie, helping her to her feet. 

“I’m okay. I’m fine.” She shook loose of his hands. “I’m 
fine. The door was stuck. | felt hot.” Charlie fanned at her 
face, trying to make a sensible story of it. “Come on, let’s 
get to the car.” He tried to take her arm again but she shook 
free. “I’m fine!” She dug her keys out of her pocket and 
walked straight for the door, not waiting for him. An old 
woman was openly staring at Charlie, her fork suspended in 
the air. Charlie returned her stare. “Food poisoning,” Charlie 
said plainly. The woman’s face went pale, and Charlie 
walked out the door. 

When they got out to her car, John sat down in the 
passenger’s seat and looked at Charlie expectantly. “You’re 
Sure you're Okay?” 


“It’s been a rough day, that’s all. I’m sorry.” 

“What happened?” 

Tell him what happened, Charlie thought. 

“l want to go to my dad’s—my old house,” she said 
instead, surprising herself. Be honest, her inner voice said 
harshly. You know what kind of creature is doing this, and 
you know who built it. Stay focused. 

“Right,” he said, his voice softening. “You haven’t seen it 
since the storm.” She nodded. He thinks | want to see the 
damage. She'd forgotten about the storm until now, but the 
sudden kindness in John’s voice made her nervous. /s there 
anything left? She imagined the house razed to the ground 
and felt a sudden wrongness, like a part of her had been 
ripped away. She’d never thought of the house as anything 
but a house, but now, as she drove toward what was left of 
it, she felt a painful knot in her stomach. It was where all her 
clearest memories of her father were kept: his rough hands 
building her toys, showing her his new creations in his 
workshop, and holding her close when she was afraid. 
They’d lived there together, just the two of them, and it was 
the place where he had finally died. Charlie felt as if the joy, 
the sorrow, the love, and the anguish of their two lifetimes 
had poured off into the very bones of the old house. The 
idea of it being wrecked by a storm was an utter violation. 

She shook her head and gripped the wheel tighter, 
suddenly aware of how angry she was. Her love of the 
house, even of her father, could never be simple. They had 
both betrayed her. But now there was a new monster out 
there. She clenched her jaw, trying to fight the tears that 
welled up in her eyes. Dad, what did you do? 

As soon as they were out of the town center, Charlie 
sped up. Clay would be tied up dealing with the newest 


victim for a while, but eventually he would think to come to 
her father’s house as well. She could only hope that she’d 
connected the dots first. You’re on the same side. Charlie 
put a hand to her head and rubbed her temple. The impulse 
to guard her father’s reputation from what was coming was 
visceral, but it was also nonsensical. 

Less than a mile from the house they passed a 
construction site. It was set back too far from the road for 
Charlie to see what it was, though it looked abandoned at 
the moment. 

“I did a little work over there when | first got here,” John 
said. “Some huge demolition project.” He laughed. “You 
have some weird stuff out here; you wouldn’t know by 
looking at it.” He studied the countryside for a moment. 

“Isn't that the truth,” Charlie said, not sure if there was 
something else she was supposed to say. She was still trying 
to calm herself. Finally, they came to her driveway. She 
pulled in with her eyes on the gravel, the house only a dark 
smudge in her peripheral vision. The last time Charlie had 
been here she’d run in and out without pausing to look at 
anything. All she’d wanted was Theodore, and she had 
grabbed him and gone. Now she regretted her haste, 
wishing for some final mental image. You’re not here to say 
good-bye. She turned the car off, steeled herself, and looked 
up. 

The house was surrounded by trees, and at least three of 
them had fallen, striking the roof directly. One had landed 
squarely on the front corner, crushing the walls beneath its 
weight. Charlie could see through the broken beams and 
crumbled drywall, into the living room. Inside there was only 
debris. 


The front door was intact, though the steps to it were 
splintered and split. They looked as if they’d give way as 
soon as they bore weight. Charlie got out of the car and 
headed toward them. 

“What are you doing?” John’s voice was alarmed. Charlie 
ignored him. She heard his door slam, and he caught her 
arm, wrenching her back. 

“What?” she snapped. 

“Charlie, look at this place. That house is going to fall 
over any day now.” 

“It’s not going to fall,” she said flatly, but she did gaze up 
again. The house seemed to be listing to the side, though it 
must have been an illusion; surely the foundation itself 
couldn’t have sunk. “I’ll be out before | get killed, | 
promise,” she said more gently, and he nodded. 

“Go slow,” he said. 

They carefully climbed the steps to the porch, staying 
close to the sides, but the wood was sturdier than it looked. 
They could have taken three steps to the right and walked 
through the open wall, but Charlie took out her key and 
unlocked the door as John waited patiently, letting her go 
through the unnecessary ritual. 

Inside, she paused at the foot of the stairs to the second 
floor. The holes in the ceiling were beaming down shafts of 
thin sunlight, dimming as the sun began to wane. It made 
the place feel almost like some sort of shrine. Charlie tore 
her eyes away from the holes and started upstairs to her 
bedroom. 

As with the outdoor steps, she kept to the side, holding 
on to the bannister. The water damage was visible 
everywhere. There were dark stains and soft spots in the 


wood. Charlie reached out to touch a place where the paint 
had bubbled out from the wall, leaving a pocket of air. 

Suddenly a cracking sound came from behind her and 
she spun around. John grabbed the bannister, struggling to 
hold on as the stair gave way under him. Charlie reached 
out, but John braced himself unsteadily. He hissed and 
gritted his teeth. 

“My foot’s stuck,” he said, nodding down. Charlie saw 
that his foot had gone clear through the wood, and now the 
jagged edges dug into his ankle. 

“Okay, hold on,” Charlie said. She crouched down until 
she could reach him on the step below her, though the 
awkward angle made it hard to maintain her balance. The 
wood was only rotting in some places, while in others it was 
still intact. She grabbed the smaller pieces and pulled them 
cautiously back from John’s foot, her hands growing raw 
with the rough and splintered surface. 

“I think I’ve got it,” John said finally, flexing his ankle. 

She looked up and grinned. “And you thought / was going 
to get myself killed.” 

John gave her a weak smile. “How about we both make it 
out alive?” 

“Right.” 

They made their way up the rest of the stairs much more 
slowly, each of them testing their weight before they took 
the next step. “Careful,” John warned as Charlie reached the 
top. 

“We won't be here long,” Charlie said. She was much 
more aware of the danger now. The house’s instability grew 
more obvious with each step they took; the very foundation 
seemed to wobble from side to side as they moved. 


Her old bedroom was on the undamaged side of the 
house—or the side not struck by trees, at least. Charlie 
stopped in the doorway, and John came up behind her. The 
floor was strewn with glass. One window had been broken 
by something, and the shattered glass had blown into the 
room. 

She took a deep breath, and it was then that she saw 
Stanley. The animatronic unicorn had once run on a track 
around her bedroom. Now he was lying on his side. Charlie 
went to him and sat down, pulling his head into her lap and 
patting his rusty cheek. He looked as if he’d been torn 
violently from his track. His legs were twisted, his hooves 
missing chunks. When she looked around the room she saw 
the missing pieces, still attached to the grooves in the floor. 

“Stanley has seen better days.” John smiled ruefully. 

“Yeah,” Charlie said absently, as she set the toy’s head 
back on the floor. “John, can you turn that wheel?” She 
pointed to a crank soldered together at the foot of her bed. 
He complied, crossing the floor agonizingly slowly. Charlie 
bit back her impatience. He turned the crank and she waited 
for the littlest closet door to open, but nothing happened. 
John looked at Charlie expectantly. 

She stood and went to the wall where the three closets 
stood, closed and apparently untouched by the weather. 
Even the paint was bright and immaculate. Charlie 
hesitated, feeling as if she might be disturbing something 
that no longer belonged to her, then forced the smallest 
door open. 

Ella was there, the doll who had been the same size as 
Charlie when she was much younger. She, like Stanley, had 
once run around on a track, and she seemed to still be 
attached to it. She was entirely undamaged. Her dress was 


clean, and the tray she held in front of her was firm in her 
motionless hands. Her wide eyes had been gazing into the 
darkness since the last time Charlie saw her. 

“Hi, Ella,” Charlie said softly. “I don’t suppose you can tell 
me what I’m looking for?” She scanned over the doll quickly 
and brushed at her dress. “You just want to stay in here 
from now on?” Charlie studied the tiny frame of the door. “| 
don’t blame you.” She closed the closet door again without 
saying good-bye. 

“So,” she said, turning back to John. He seemed lost in 
thought, staring at something in his hand. 

“What is that?” Charlie asked. 

“A photo of you, when you were no bigger than her.” John 
smiled and gestured toward Ella’s door, then handed the 
picture to Charlie. 

It looked like a school photo. A short, chubby girl gave a 
toothy grin for the camera—minus one tooth. Charlie smiled 
back at her. “I don’t remember this.” 

“That doll is a little creepy, standing in the closet,” John 
said. “I’m a bit on edge, | won’t lie.” 

“Waiting for a tea party,” Charlie said acerbically. “How 
sinister.” She started to leave the room, but as her hand 
touched the doorframe, she paused. Doors. She stepped 
back through into her bedroom, and looked for a long 
moment at each of the rectangular closet doors. “John,” she 
whispered. 

“What?” John looked up, trying to follow Charlie’s gaze. 

“Doors,” Charlie whispered. She took several long steps 
back to study the whole wall at once. The scribbles all over 
her notebooks had been shaped like dozens—hundreds—of 
rectangles. She drew them without thinking, as if they were 


pushing up through her mind, trying to break out of her 
subconscious. Now they had. “They’re doors,” she repeated. 

“Yes. Yes, | see.” John tilted his head curiously. “Are you 
okay?” 

“Yes, I’m fine. | mean, I’m not sure.” She ran her eyes 
over the wall of closets again. Doors. But not these doors. 

“Come on, let’s go look at the workshop,” John said. 
“Maybe we can find something else there.” 

“Right.” She gave a pained smile. She looked back once 
more at the three closets that sat in silence. 

John nodded, and they went cautiously back down the 
stairs, testing each step before they took it. Outside, they 
stopped by the car. The workshop was invisible from the 
driveway, hidden behind the house. The backyard had once 
been surrounded by trees, a small wood that acted as a 
fence. 

“Don’t go into the woods, Charlie,” she said, then smiled 
at John. “That’s what he always told me, like something out 
of a fairy tale.” They walked a bit farther, twigs snapping 
under their feet. “But the woods were only ten feet deep,” 
she said, still peering into the trees as though something 
might leap out. As a child these trees had seemed 
impenetrable, a forest she might be lost in forever, if she 
dared to wander in. She started toward what remained of 
them, then stopped dead when she saw where some of the 
fallen trees had landed. 

Her father’s workshop had been crushed. A massive 
trunk had hit the workshop’s roof dead center, and others 
had come with it on all sides. The wall closest to the house 
was still standing, but it was bowed beneath the sagging 
roof. 


It had been a garage when they moved in, and then it 
had become her father’s world: a place of light and shadow 
that smelled of hot metal and burnt plastic. Charlie peered 
down at the rotting wood and broken glass with careful 
attention, looking for something she might otherwise miss. 

“We're definitely not going in there,” John said. 

But Charlie was already lifting a piece of sheet metal that 
had once belonged to the roof. She threw it violently to the 
side, and it hit the ground with a resounding clang. John 
startled and kept his distance as Charlie continued to throw 
things. “What are you—what are we looking for?” 

Charlie wrestled a toy from under the debris and threw it 
carelessly to the ground behind her, continuing to lift sheets 
of metal and toss them aside. “Charlie,” John whispered, 
picking up the delicate toy and cradling it. “He must have 
made this for you.” 

Charlie ignored him. “There’s got to be something else in 
here.” She fought her way deeper into the workshop, 
toppling a wooden beam out of her way. Her hand slipped 
on the wood, and she realized it was wet; her arm was 
bleeding. She wiped her hand on her jeans. From the corner 
of her eye, she saw John set the toy carefully on the ground 
and follow her in. 

Amazingly, there were still shelves and tables standing 
upright, with tools and shreds of fabric where her father had 
last set them. Charlie glanced at them for a passing 
moment, then swept her arm across the table nearest her, 
knocking everything to the ground. She didn’t pause to see 
what had fallen before moving to the shelves. She began 
picking things off the nearest shelf one item at a time, 
inspecting them and throwing them to the ground. When 
the shelf was empty, she grabbed the board itself with both 


hands, wrenching at it violently, trying to pull it from the 
wall. When it didn’t come loose, she began pounding at it 
with her fists. 

“Stop!” John ran to her and grabbed her hands, pinning 
them to her sides. 

“There has to be something here!” she screamed. “I’m 
supposed to be here, but | don’t know what it is that I’m 
supposed to find.” 

“What are you talking about? There’s a lot left. Look at 
this stuff!” He held the toy up to her again. 

“This isn’t about the storm, John. It’s not about happy 
memories, or closure, or whatever you think | need. This is 
about monsters. They’re out there, and they’re killing 
people. And you and | both know that there is only one 
place they could have come from: here.” 

“You don’t know that,” John began. Charlie looked at him 
with a stony rage, stopping him short. 

“I’m surrounded by monsters, and murder, and death, 
and spirits.” At the last word her fury ebbed, and she turned 
away from John, surveying the workshop. She wasn’t sure 
now what damage the storm had done, and what had been 
her. “All | can think about is Sammy. | fee/ him. Right now, | 
can feel him in this place, but he’s—cut off. It doesn’t even 
make sense. He died before my father and | moved here. 
But | know I’m here for a reason. There’s something that I’m 
supposed to find. It’s all connected, but | don’t know how. 
Maybe something to do with the doors ... | don’t know.” 

“Hey, okay. We'll find it together.” John reached out for 
her. Charlie’s strength gave way and she let him pull her 
close, pressing her face into his shirt. “I know it’s hard to 
see everything torn apart like this,” he said. Charlie’s anger 
drained away, fading into exhaustion. She rested her head 


on John’s shoulder, wishing she could stay like this just a 
little longer. 

“Charlie,” John said with alarm, and Charlie came back to 
attention. He was looking over her shoulder, in the direction 
of the house. 

The entire back face of the house had been torn open, as 
if someone had taken a massive hammer to it; inside was 
only dark. 

“That’s right under your room, isn’t it? We could have 
fallen through the floor,” John said. 

“That should be the living room,” Charlie said, wiping her 
sleeve across her face. 

“Yeah, but it’s not.” John looked at her expectantly. 

“That’s not even a part of the house,” she said. A sudden 
spark of hope revived inside her. Something was out of 
place. That meant there was something to find. 

Charlie approached the chasm, and John didn’t try to 
stop her as she climbed up several large slabs of broken 
concrete. John stayed a step behind her, close enough to 
catch her if she slipped. Charlie turned to him before 
entering. “Thank you,” she said. John nodded. 

“I’ve never seen this room before,” Charlie whispered as 
she crept into the hollow space. The walls were made of 
dark concrete, and the room was small and windowless, a 
box jammed into the house and sealed away between the 
rooms. There were no decorations, and nothing to indicate 
what was stored here. Just a dirt floor and three large holes, 
deep and oblong like graves. 

“Those don’t look like storm damage,” John said. 

“They're not.” Charlie went up to the edge of the nearest 
hole, looking down. 

“Were you ... expecting to find these?” 


These holes were deeper than the ones she’d found at 
Tracy Horton’s house. Perhaps it was the shadowy room, but 
these looked like real graves. They were a foot or so deeper 
than the ones she’d found before and partially filled with 
loose dirt. 

John was standing patiently behind her, waiting for her 
answer. 

“I’ve seen them before,” she admitted. “Behind the 
house of a dead woman.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

Charlie sighed. “There was another body. | found her 
today, in a field. | called Clay, and then | went to her house 
while he waited for the rest of the cops to show up. There 
were holes like this in her backyard.” 

“That’s what you wouldn’t tell me? Another body?” John 
sounded hurt, but his wounded expression lasted only 
seconds before it cleared. He started scanning the room 
again, his eyes intent on the walls and floor. 

That, and the fact that she looked like me, Charlie 
thought. 

“So what do you think the holes are?” he asked finally. 

Charlie barely heard him. Her gaze had fixed on the 
blank concrete wall on the far side of the room. It was 
empty, whitewashed then left to turn gray with dust and 
mildew. But something drew her to it. Leaving John alone by 
the open graves, Charlie walked slowly to it, drawn there by 
a sense of sudden recognition. It was like she’d just 
remembered a word that had been on the tip of her tongue 
for days. 

She hesitated, holding her hands out flat, less than an 
inch from the wall, uncertain what was holding her back. 
She steeled herself and placed her palms against the wall. It 


was cold. She felt a slight shock of surprise, as though she’d 
expected to feel warmth from the other side. John was 
speaking, but to her it was only murmurs in the distance. 
She turned her head and delicately placed her ear against 
the surface, closing her eyes. Movement? 

“Hey!” John’s voice broke her focus, waking her as if from 
a trance. “Over here!” 

She turned. John was bent over the mound of dirt next to 
the farthest grave. Charlie started toward him, but he put 
up a hand to stop her. 

“No, come around the other way.” 

She carefully made her way around the perimeter of the 
little room until she was beside him. At first she couldn’t tell 
what he was trying to show her. Something was almost 
visible, veiled in a thin layer of dirt, so that it blended into 
the ground as if deliberately camouflaged. 

But eventually she saw it—rusted metal, and the glint of 
a staring, plastic eye. She glanced at John, who just looked 
back at her. This was her territory now. Carefully, Charlie 
poked the mostly buried head of the thing with the toe of 
her sneaker, then yanked her foot back. The thing didn’t 
move. 

“What the heck is this?” John asked, glancing around the 
room. “And why is it in here?” 

“I’ve never seen this before,” Charlie said. She knelt, 
curiosity overtaking her fear, then used her hand to scrape 
aside some of the dirt, clearing off a little more of the 
creature’s face. Behind her, John drew a sharp breath. 
Charlie just stared down. The creature had no fur, and its 
face was smooth. It had a short muzzle and oval ears 
sticking out from the sides of the head. It had the general 
appearance of an animal’s head, though much larger than 


the animatronic animals from Freddy’s. Charlie couldn’t 
guess what kind of animal it was supposed to be. Running 
down the center of its face was a long, straight split, 
exposing wires and a line of metal frame. A thick plastic 
material was stuck to the face in large patches. Maybe it 
had been encased in it at some point. 

“Do you recognize it?” John asked quietly. 

Charlie shook her head. “No,” she managed to say after 
a moment. “Something’s wrong with it.” She brushed back 
more dirt and found it came away easily. The thing had only 
been partially buried beneath the floor; that, or it had 
almost escaped. She started digging her hands into the dirt, 
trying to pry it out of what remained of its grave. 

“You've got to be kidding me.” John groaned as he knelt 
to help, getting his hands around any part of it he could. In 
one concentrated effort, they heaved it upward, managing 
to pull most of the torso out of the dirt. They let it drop, then 
fell back on the ground to study it while they caught their 
breath. 

Like the face, the body was smoother than the 
animatronics that Charlie was used to. It had no fur, and no 
tail or other animal appendages. It was too large for a 
human being to wear, probably eight feet tall when 
standing. Still, Charlie couldn’t shake the feeling that she 
recognized this creature. Foxy. 

There was something sick about the creature, a 
weirdness that gripped her at the most basic, primal level 
and cried, This is wrong. Charlie closed her eyes for a 
moment. Her skin felt strange, like something was crawling 
all over it. /t’s just an oversized doll. Sne took a deep, 
deliberate breath, opened her eyes, and inched forward to 
examine the thing. 


As her hand touched the creature, a wave of nausea hit 
her, but it lasted only a split second. She continued. She 
turned the head to the side, its joints resisting. The left side 
of its skull had been crushed. Charlie could see that the 
insides were broken, half the wires torn out. Just behind the 
eye, on the side that had been completely buried, a piece of 
the casing was missing. She could see a mass of plastic with 
a tangle of wires running in and out of it. Something had 
melted one of the circuit boards. Moving slowly down the 
body, Charlie examined its joints: one arm seemed fine, but 
on the other both the shoulder and elbow joints had been 
bent out of shape. Charlie looked up at John, who was 
watching her with a worried expression. 

“Anything familiar?” 

“| don’t recognize it. It’s not something my dad ever 
showed me,” Charlie said. 

“Maybe we should put it back in the ground and get out 
of here. This feels like it was a mistake.” 

“But on the inside ...” Charlie ignored him. “The 
hardware, the joints—it’s older technology. Maybe he made 
them earlier? | don’t know.” 

“How can you tell?” 

“| recognize some of this as my dad’s work.” She frowned 
and pointed at the creature’s head. “But then a lot of it is 
foreign to me. Someone else may have had a hand in it. I’m 
not sure if my dad made it or not, but | have a feeling he’s 
the one who buried it.” 

“I can’t imagine it was designed to be onstage. It’s 
hideous.” John was noticeably nervous, and now he placed 
his hand on Charlie’s arm. “Let’s get out of here. This place 
gives me the creeps.” 


mu 


““Gives me the creeps,’” Charlie said lightly. “Who says 
that? I’m going to try and get it the rest of the way out. | 
just want to see ...” She moved away from John’s touch, 
leaning down to dig again by the creature’s buried torso. 

“Charlie!” John cried, just as a metal shriek rang out. 

The animatronic’s arms lifted, and its chest opened like 
an iron gate. Its metal pieces slid out of place to reveal a 
dark, gaping pit where sharp spikes and spring locks were 
just barely visible. It was a trap waiting to be triggered. Yet, 
disorientingly, something else about it had transformed at 
the same time. Its artificial skin took on a luminescence, and 
its movements were fluid and sure. Its casing suddenly 
appeared to have skin and fur, though they were blurry, 
flickering like a trick of the light. 

Charlie jumped backward, but it was too late: the thing 
had her in its grip and lifted her high into the air. It was 
pulling her toward it. She beat against its bent and 
damaged arm, but the other arm steadily forced her closer 
to the chest cavity. John stumbled backward for a moment, 
bending forward with one hand over his mouth, as if struck 
by a wave of nausea. 

Charlie struggled to break free, but her strength was no 
match for the creature. Out of the corner of her eye she 
could see John lunging toward the beast. He grabbed its 
head, wrenching at it, trying to force it sideways. Beneath 
Charlie, the animatronic began to spasm, a stuttering, 
uncontrolled movement. The creature’s grip came loose and 
its arms swung around wildly. Charlie struggled to get to her 
feet, but her legs slid in the dirt. The creature seized her 
again, and its cold fingers drew her closer. 

Charlie braced her shoe against the ground, trying to 
give herself leverage, but she was being pulled down by an 


overwhelming force. Suddenly she was face-to-face with the 
beast, her shoulder already inside its chest cavity. The thing 
pressed her closer, then suddenly it jerked and released her. 
She rolled away and heard the sound of snapping spring 
locks. The creature convulsed on the ground in front of her, 
headless. Charlie looked at John. He was holding the thing’s 
head in his hands, his eyes wide with shock. He dropped it 
and kicked it across the floor. 

“Are you Okay?” John scrambled to her. Charlie nodded, 
staring at the broken animatronic head. It still seemed alive. 
Its fur bristled and skin moved, as if there were muscle and 
sinew underneath. 

“What the heck just happened?” 

John raised both hands in surrender. 

Charlie carefully picked up the massive head and flipped 
it upside down, peering into it through the base where John 
had torn it off the neck. 

“Ugh.” John bent over, his hands on his knees. His face 
was pale. He stifled a retching sound. 

Charlie started toward him, surprised. “What’s wrong 
with you? You’ve seen worse than this.” 

“No, it’s not that. | don’t know what it is.” He 
straightened, then stumbled toward the wall, bracing 
himself. “It’s like there’s some horrible smell in the air, but 
without the smell.” 

Charlie held her finger to her ear, listening. There was a 
tone in the air, so high-pitched and quiet it was almost 
imperceptible. “I think something is still ... on,” she said. 
She set the giant head on the ground. John had a hand to 
his ear, listening, but when she looked at him he shook his 
head. 

“| can’t hear anything.” 


Charlie returned to the body of the creature and peered 
into its gaping chest cavity. “Are you okay?” she asked 
halfheartedly, not taking her eyes off the robot. 

“Yeah, | feel better back here.” He heaved and she 
turned. John’s face was strained, and his arm was tight 
across his stomach. “I think it’s passing,” he said, then 
doubled over, barely getting out the last syllable. 

“This thing.” Charlie clenched her teeth and jerked her 
weight back and forth, trying to wrestle something loose 
from inside the chest cavity. 

“Charlie get away from it!” John took a step toward her, 
then swayed back, as if he were tethered to the wall. “There 
is something rea//y wrong with that thing.” 

“Now this I’ve seen before,” Charlie said as she pulled 
the object out at last. It was a flat disc, about the size of a 
half-dollar coin. She held it up to her ear. “Wow, that’s really 
high-pitched. | can barely hear it. The sound is why you feel 
Sick.” 

Charlie wedged her fingernail into a small groove on the 
side of the object and flipped a thin switch. John took 
several deep breaths, then stood upright again slowly, 
testing himself. He looked at Charlie. “It stopped,” she said. 

“Charlie,” John whispered, nodding toward the beast on 
the ground. Charlie looked, and a shock went through her. 
The illusion of fur and flesh was gone. It was nothing more 
than a broken robot with unfinished features. 

John picked up the head once again, turning it to face 
them. “That thing, it did something,” John said, nodding 
toward the device in Charlie’s hands. “Turn it back on.” He 
lifted the creature’s head a bit higher and stared into its 
lifeless round eyes. 


Are you sure that’s a good idea? she was about to say, 
but curiosity got the better of her. John could handle a little 
more nausea. She slipped her nail back into the groove and 
flipped the tiny switch. Before their eyes, the fractured and 
worn face became fluid and smooth, warping into something 
lifelike. John dropped the head and jumped backward. 

“It’s alive!” 

“No, it’s not,” Charlie whispered, flipping the switch off 
again. She cradled the strange device in her hands, gazing 
down at it, mesmerized. “Il want to know more about this. 
We have to get back to the dorm.” She got to her feet. “I’ve 
seen something like this. When | came back here for 
Theodore, | grabbed a bunch of stuff and put it in a box to 
study later. | Know | saw something like this.” 

For a long moment, John said nothing. Charlie felt a surge 
of shame. He was looking at her the way Jessica had, the 
way he had when he first saw her experiment. The little disc 
in Charlie’s palm felt suddenly like the most vital thing in 
the world. She closed her hand on it. 

“Okay, then,” John said plainly. “Let’s go.” His tone was 
calm, and it caught Charlie off guard. John was being 
deliberately agreeable. She wasn’t sure exactly why, but it 
was reassuring nonetheless. 

“Okay.” Charlie smiled. 





When they got back to the college, Charlie headed for the 
dorm. 

“Hey, slow down!” John struggled to catch up. 

“You have that disc?” 

“Of course.” He patted his pocket. 

“| know I’ve seen something like this before,” she said. 
“I'll show you.” She glanced at John as she let him into the 
room she shared with Jessica, but his face remained 
impassive. He’d already seen the mess. But John didn’t look 
in the direction of Charlie’s desk and the covered faces. 

“You can clear off the chair,” Charlie said as she shoved a 
stack of books out of the way. She crawled under the bed 
and emerged a moment later with a large cardboard box. 
John was standing beside the chair, looking perplexed. “1 
said you can Clear it off,” she said. 


He laughed. “Clear it off to where?” 

“Right.” The chair had a stack of books on the seat, and 
a stack of T-shirts draped over the back. Charlie grabbed the 
shirts and threw them onto the bed. She set the box on the 
bed and settled herself cross-legged behind it, so that John 
would be able to look through it, too. 

“So what is all of this?” He leaned slowly over the box as 
Charlie rummaged through it, pulling parts out one by one 
and setting them in a straight line on the bed. 

“Stuff from my dad’s house: electronics, mechanical 
parts. Things from the animatronics, from his work.” She 
glanced at him nervously. “I know | said that | just went back 
for Theodore, and | did. But | may have grabbed a few 
things on the way out. | wanted to learn, and these classes 
—John, you know some of the tech my father was working 
with was ancient. It’s practically ridiculous now. But he was 
making it up as he went along; he thought of stuff that’s still 
unique, that no one else has thought of yet. | wanted all of 
it. | wanted to understand it. So, | went back to get what | 
could.” 

“You stripped the house for parts, | get it.” John laughed 
as he picked up Theodore’s severed paw and considered it 
fora moment. “Even your favorite toy? Don’t you think 
that’s a little ... heartless?” 

“Is it?” Charlie picked up a piece from the box, a metal 
joint, and weighed it in her hands. “I took Theodore apart 
because | wanted to understand him, John. Isn’t that the 
most loving thing there is?” 

“Maybe | should reconsider this whole dating thing,” John 
said, wide-eyed. 

“He was important to me because my father made him 
for me, not because he was stitched up to look like a 


rabbit.” She discarded the joint, setting it next to her on the 
bed. She turned her attention to the box, picking up pieces 
one by one and setting them in a row. She was sure she’d 
recognize what she needed when she saw it. 

Charlie looked at circuitry and wires, metal joints and 
plastic casings, examining each piece carefully. Something 
would cry out to her, just like the animatronic beast had 
done, with that raw sense of wrongness. But after a while 
her neck grew sore from bending over the box. Her eyes 
were beginning to glaze over. She discarded the piece of 
metal tubing in her hand, tossing it onto the growing pile on 
her bed. At the clanking sound, John looked up. 

“Where do you even sleep?” he asked, gesturing not only 
to the growing pile of electronic and mechanical parts, but 
to the clothing and books, and the smaller piles of electronic 
and mechanical parts. 

Charlie shrugged. “There’s always room for me,” she said 
mildly. “Even if just barely.” 

“Yeah, but what about when you’re married?” John’s face 
flushed before he’d even finished the sentence. Charlie 
looked up at him, one eyebrow hinged slightly higher than 
the other. “Someday,” John said hastily. “To someone. Else.” 
His face grew grimmer. Charlie felt her eyebrow lift higher of 
its own volition. “So, what are we looking for again?” John 
furrowed his brow and scooted his chair closer to the bed, 
peering into the box. 

“This.” Spotting a glimmer in the pile, Charlie took hold 
of a small disc and carefully placed it in the palm of her 
hand. She held it out so John could see. It looked just like 
the metallic disc they’d found in the body of the 
animatronic, but one side of it had been damaged, revealing 
a curious metal framework inside. Several wires extended, 


connecting to a black keypad not much larger than the disc 
itself. 

“Funny.” Charlie chuckled to herself. 

“What?” 

“The last time | held this, | was more interested in the 
keypad.” She smiled. “This part is a common diagnostic 
tool. Someone must have been testing it.” 

“Or trying to find out what it was,” John added. “That 
thing doesn’t look like anything else in the box; just like that 
monster we found doesn’t look like anything your dad 
made. | mean, it kind of looked like Foxy, but not the one 
your dad made. This was some sort of twisted version of 
Foxy.” 

She pulled a heavy metal joint from the box. “This 
doesn’t belong here, either.” 

“What's wrong with it?” 

“It’s meant to be an elbow, but look.” She bent the joint 
all the way over, then all the way back the other way, then 
looked at John expectantly. 

He looked blank. “So?” 

“My father wouldn’t have used this. He always put stops 
so that the joints couldn’t do things humans can’t do.” 

“Maybe it’s not finished?” 

“It’s finished. It’s not just that, though, it’s ... it’s the way 
the metal is cut, the way it’s put together. It’s like—you 
write things, right? So, you read other people’s work?” He 
nodded. “If | ripped up some books and gave you a big pile 
of pages, and asked you to pick out the ones by your 
favorite author, could you do that, just based on the style?” 

“Yeah, of course. | mean, | might be wrong about a few, 
but yeah.” 


“Well, it’s the same thing here.” She held the heavy 
piece up again to make her point. “My dad didn’t write this. 

“Okay, but what does it mean?” John asked. He 
unplugged the broken disc from the diagnostic keypad and 
took the second disc from the monster out of his pocket. He 
fiddled with it briefly, then managed to unhinge one side of 
it. Frowning with concentration, he attached the wires from 
the keypad to the new disc. When he was finished, he 
hesitated. “I don’t want to flip any of the switches,” he said. 
“I don’t think my stomach can take it.” 

“Yeah, don’t touch anything yet. After what happened at 
the house, we shouldn’t assume that we know what any of 
this does.” Charlie set the box on the floor and started 
shuffling through the parts again, looking at the patterns, 
trying to see something in them. “There has to be 
something else in here that I’m missing.” 

“Charlie,” John said. “Sorry to interrupt your conversation 
with yourself, but look.” He passed her the broken disc he’d 
just unhooked. “Look on the back.” 

The back had once been smooth, but it was scratched a 
lot since it was first made. Charlie stared at it for a minute, 
then finally saw it: there was writing along one edge. She 
had to bring the piece of plastic close to her face to make 
the letters out. They were tiny, and written in an old- 
fashioned, flowing script. They read: Afton Robotics, LLC. 
Charlie dropped the disc immediately. 

“Afton? William Afton? That’s my father’s old partner. 
That’s—” 

“That’s Dave’s real name,” John finished. Charlie sat 
silently for a moment, feeling as if something very large and 
unwieldy had been shoved into her head. 


” 


“| thought he was just a business partner for Freddy’s,” 
she said slowly. 

“| guess he did a bit more than that.” 

“He’s dead, though. It’s not like we can ask him 
questions. We have to figure out what’s happening now.” 
She grabbed the cardboard box and swept the extraneous 
pieces—the pieces that had been her father’s—into it, then 
shoved it back under the bed. John ducked out of her way as 
she maneuvered around the small space. 

“And how do you think we should do that?” he asked. 
“What is happening now? There have been two bodies so 
far, both killed by something like what we just found.” 

“Three bodies,” Charlie said, flushing slightly. John 
covered his face with his hands for a moment and took a 
deep breath. 

“Okay, three. Are you sure it’s not four?” 

“Il didn’t see the third one. Clay just told me about it, 
after she was found. It had been out for a few days—she 
was the first one, | think.” 

“So why them? Are these robots just going on a killing 
spree? Why would they do that? Charlie, is there anything 
else about this that you’re not telling me?” Charlie bit her 
lip, hesitant. “I’m serious. I’m in this with you, but if | don’t 
know what’s happening, | can’t help you.” 

Charlie nodded. “I don’t know if it means anything. Clay 
said it was just a coincidence. But the woman | found in the 
field—John, she looked like me.” 

His expression went dark. “What do you mean, looked 
like you?” 

“Not exactly like me. Brown hair, same size, sort of. | 
don’t know, if you described me to someone and asked 
them to pick me out of a crowd, they might come back with 


her. There was just this awful moment when | looked down 
at her, and it was like looking at me.” 

“Clay said it didn’t mean anything?” 

“He said it’s a college town; there are a lot of brown- 
haired girls around. One of the other two victims was a man, 
SO ... 
“Probably a coincidence then,” John offered. 

“Yeah,” Charlie said. “I guess it was just ... unsettling.” 

“There must be something else that’s linking them 
together. Another person, a job, a location maybe.” John 
looked toward the window. Charlie caught him smiling, and 
John’s expression sobered, looking suddenly self-conscious. 

“You're enjoying this,” she said. 

“No.” He shrugged. “I wouldn’t put it that way. | don’t 
want any more bodies. But—it’s a mystery, and it’s an 
excuse to spend some time with you.” He smiled, but 
quickly made his face serious again. “So what about the 
bodies? Where were they found?” 

“Well.” Charlie brushed the hair off her face, slightly 
distracted. “They were all found in fields, miles apart. The 
first one—the one they just found—was over on the far side 
of Hurricane, and the girl | found today was left by the side 
of the road between Hurricane and here.” 

“Where on the road? How far from here?” 

“About halfway ...” Suddenly her eyes widened. “Forget 
the fields. Or don’t forget them, but they’re not the point, or 
at least not the whole point. The holes were behind the 
woman’s house. They take them from their homes. That’s 
where they’re starting; it’s where we should start, too.” She 
headed for the door, and John followed. 

“Wait, what? Where are we going?” 

“My car. | want to look at a map.” 


” 


When they got to the car, Charlie pulled a stack of 
papers out of the glove compartment and rifled through 
them, then pulled out a map and handed it to John. 

“Give mea pen.” She held out her hand, and John pulled 
two from his front pocket, handing her one. Charlie spread 
the map out on the hood of the car and they bent over it. 

“The woman’s house was here,” she said, circling the 
spot. “Clay gave me the addresses of the others.” She 
pulled the now slightly grubby menu from her pocket and 
handed it to John. “You look for that one,” she said quietly. 

Even though they both knew the area, tracing the streets 
for the victim’s houses took longer than Charlie had 
expected. 

“Found it,” John announced. 

“1158 Oak Street is right ... there.” She circled the point 
and stepped back. 

“What's that?” John said, pointing to something scribbled 
in the margin. Charlie picked up the corner of the map and 
her heart skipped. It was another drawing of a rectangle. 
She didn’t remember making it. /t’s a door. But what door? 
She stared down at it. It had no knobs or latches, nothing to 
indicate how she would get inside. Or where it was. What 
good is it to know what I’m looking for, if | don’t know why, 
or how to find it? 

“Just a doodle,” she said sternly, to redirect his attention. 
“Come on, concentrate.” 

“Yeah,” John said. At least the pattern was instantly clear; 
the houses made a crooked line from Hurricane toward St. 
George, truncated halfway between. 

“They're all about the same distance apart,” Charlie said, 
a swell of dread rising in her chest. John was nodding as if 
he understood. “What does it mean?” she asked urgently. 


“They’re moving in a specific direction, and traveling 
roughly the same distance between.” He paused. “Killing.” 

“Who's killing who?” A voice rang out behind them. 

Charlie gasped and whirled around, her heart pounding. 
Jessica was behind her, holding a stack of books to her 
chest. Her eyes were wide and a grin of excitement broke 
across her face. 

“We were just talking about the movie we saw last 
night,” John said with a casual smile. 

“Oh yeah, okay.” Jessica gave him a quick look of faux 
seriousness and glanced at Charlie. “So, Charlie, what’s the 
map for?” she asked, gesturing at it elaborately. “Oh, does it 
have to do with Freddy’s?” she said with excitement in her 
voice. John looked at Charlie suspiciously. 

“Did she tell you?” Jessica looked to John, and John 
looked back at Charlie, eager to hear the rest. 

“Jessica, now probably isn’t the best time,” Charlie said 
feebly. 

“We went to Freddy’s yesterday,” Jessica said ina 
hushed tone, although no one else was around. 

“Oh, really? Funny, Charlie didn’t mention that. Was that 
before or after all that shopping?” John folded his arms. 

“| was going to tell you,” Charlie murmured. 

“Charlie, sometimes | think you’re just trying to get 
yourself killed.” John put his hand over his face. 

“So what’s the map for?” Jessica repeated. “What are we 
looking for?” 

“Monsters,” Charlie said. “New ... animatronics. They’re 
murdering people, seemingly at random,” she continued, 
not fully convinced of what she’d just said. 

Jessica’s face grew grave, but her eyes still held a twinkle 
of eagerness as she walked around the side of the car to 


dump her books on the backseat. “How? Where did they 
come from? Freddy’s?” 

“No, not Freddy’s. They came from my dad’s house, we 
think. But they weren't his, Jessica. He didn’t build them. We 
think it was Dave ... Afton ... whatever his name is.” The 
words had come tumbling out all at once, nonsensical, and 
John stepped in to translate. 

“She means that—” 

“No, | get it,” Jessica cut in. “You don’t have to talk to me 
like I’m uninitiated. | was at Freddy’s last year, too, 
remember? I’ve seen some crazy things. So, what are we 
going to do?” She looked at Charlie, her game face on. She 
looked far more together than Charlie felt. 

“We don’t know what any of it means for sure,” John said. 
“We're still figuring it out.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Jessica asked. Charlie looked 
up at her hesitantly. 

“| just didn’t want it to be like last time,” she said. 
“There’s no need to put everyone at risk.” 

“Yeah, just me.” John smirked. 

“| get that,” Jessica said. “But after what happened last 
time ... | mean, we're in this together.” 

John leaned back against the car, glancing around for 
anyone who might be listening. 

“So...” Jessica stepped around her to look at the map. 
“What are we doing?” 

Charlie leaned in and squinted at the distance key on the 
map. “There’s about three miles between each location.” 
She studied the map again for a moment, then drew 
another circle. “That’s my house—my dad’s house.” She 
looked up at John. “Whatever is out there killing people 
came from there. They must have ...” Her voice trailed off. 


“When the storm broke the wall,” John muttered. 

“What?” Jessica asked. 

“A section of the house was sealed until the storm broke 
through.” 

With firm strokes, Charlie drew a straight line from her 
father’s house, through the three houses of the victims, and 
continued the line across the map. “That can’t be right,” 
Jessica said when she saw where the line finally ended. John 
peered over Charlie’s shoulder. 

“Isn't that your college?” he asked. 

“Yeah, it’s our dorm.” The excitement had left Jessica’s 
voice. “That doesn’t make any sense.” 

Charlie couldn’t take her eyes off the paper. It felt a little 
like she had drawn the path to her own death. “It wasn’t a 
coincidence,” she said. 

“What are you talking about?” 

“Don’t you get it?” She let out a faint laugh, unable to 
stop herself. “It’s me. They’re coming for me. They’re 
looking for me!” 

“What? Who are they?” Jessica looked to John. 

“There were three empty ... graves at her dad’s house. 
So, there must be three of them out there somewhere.” 

“They move at night,” Charlie said. “Il mean they can’t 
walk around in the daylight. So they find a place to bury 
themselves until nightfall.” 

“Even if you’re right, and they’re coming for you,” John 
said, bending down and trying to catch her eye, “now we 
know they’re coming. And going by this, we can at least 
guess where they might go next.” 

“So, what are you saying? What does that matter?” 
Charlie heard her own voice break. 


“It matters because those things are out there, right now, 
buried in someone’s yard. And when the sun goes down 
they’re going to kill again, in the most horrible way 
possible.” Charlie said nothing, her head bowed. “Look.” 
John straightened out the map and pushed it into Charlie’s 
lap, so she couldn’t help but see it. “Somewhere in here.” 
He pointed to the next circled area on the line. “We can stop 
them if we can find them first,” John said with urgency. 

“Okay.” Charlie took a breath. “We don’t have much time, 
though.” 

John grabbed the map, and they all got into the car. 

“Just tell me where to go,” Charlie said grimly. 

John peered down at the map. “So this is where we need 
to be?” he confirmed, pointing to the fifth circle, and Charlie 
nodded. He turned the map and squinted. “Turn left out of 
the parking lot, then take the next right. | know this place. 
I’ve driven past it. It’s an apartment complex. It’s pretty run- 
down from what | remember.” 

Jessica leaned forward, poking her head between the 
front seats. “Those circles don’t look too precise; it could be 
anywhere in the area.” 

“Yeah, but I’m guessing it’s going to be the place with 
the three fresh graves in the backyard,” John said. 

Charlie glanced at each of them for a second before 
fixing her eyes back on the road. There was safety in 
numbers. Last year when they were trapped at Freddy’s 
together, Jessica was the one who had gotten them inside 
the restaurant in the first place. She was brave, even when 
she didn’t want to be, and that meant more than whatever 
notion of romance John was entertaining. 

“Charlie, turn right!” John exclaimed. She yanked the 
wheel, barely making the turn. Focus. /mminent murder 


first, everything else later. 

Before them lay sprawling fields, lots marked out and 
prepared for construction and future development but never 
finished. Some had never even begun. Slabs of concrete 
were stacked here and there, almost completely obscured 
by overgrowth. A few lots away, steel beams had been 
erected to make a foundation that was never filled in. The 
place had decayed before it was completed. 

In the farthest lot back was a cluster of what seemed to 
be finished apartment complexes. Grass and weeds grew 
rampant around them, however, climbing up their very 
walls; it looked like years of growth. It was hard to tell 
whether anyone lived inside. Years ago, the city had been 
diligently preparing for a population boom, one that never 
arrived. 

“Are there even people out here?” Jessica was gazing out 
the window. 

“There must be. There are parked cars.” John craned his 
neck. “I think those are cars. | don’t know where we’re 
Supposed to look, though.” 

“| think we just have to drive around.” Charlie slowed the 
car as they traversed the road leading toward the buildings. 
“Maybe not,” John said. “I bet it’s somewhere near the 
edge of the development. Most people would probably call 
the police if they saw eight-foot monsters digging holes in 
someone's backyard. There is a lot of visibility out here.” 

“Of course,” Charlie said with dread in her voice. 
“They’re buried, out of sight, and strategically placing 
themselves so as not to be found.” She looked at John 
expectantly, but he just stared back. “They’re intelligent,” 
she explained. “I think | would have liked it better if they 
were just roaming the streets mindlessly. At least then 


someone could call the national guard or something.” 
Charlie kept her eyes on the fields. 

They drove around the outer edges of the development 
Slowly, looking at the yards of each house. Some of the 
buildings looked abandoned, the windows boarded up or 
torn out completely, opening the apartments to the 
elements. The storm had done its damage, but little had 
been done to repair it. A tree had fallen across one cul-de- 
sac, blocking a building off completely. But it didn’t look like 
anyone was trying to get in or out; the tree rotted where it 
lay. There was litter strewn in the abandoned streets, 
collecting in the gutters and bolstering the curbs. Maybe 
one apartment in five had curtains in the window. 

Occasionally they passed a parked car or a toppled 
tricycle on the patchy grass. No one came outside, though 
Charlie thought she saw a curtain pull shut as they drove 
past. In two backyards there were aboveground pools filled 
by rainwater, and one had a large trampoline, its springs 
rusted and its canvas torn. 

“Just a second.” Charlie pulled to a stop, leaving the car 
running as she approached a tall wooden fence. It was too 
high to climb, but there was a single board that hung loose 
off its nail near the base. She squatted down and pried it 
away to peek inside. 

Two round black eyes glared at her. 

Charlie froze. The eyes belonged to a dog, a massive 
thing, which started to bark, its teeth gnashing and its chain 
clanking. Charlie slammed the board back in place and 
walked to the car. “Okay, let’s keep going.” 

“Nothing?” Jessica asked dubiously, and Charlie shook 
her head. “Maybe they didn’t make it this far.” 


“Il think they did,” Charlie said. “I think they’re doing 
exactly what they mean to.” She pulled the car over to the 
shoulder of the winding road and looked at the apartment 
buildings on either side. “This could have been a nice place 
to live,” she said softly. 

“Why are we stopping?” John looked confused. 

Charlie leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes. 
Locked in a box, a dark and cramped box, can’t move, can’t 
see, can’t think. Let me out! Her eyes flew open, and she 
grabbed the handle of the car door in a panic. She pulled 
against it hard. 

“It’s locked,” John said. He leaned across her to pull up 
the button lock. 

“Il know that,” she said angrily. She got out and closed 
the door. John moved to follow her, but Jessica placed her 
hand on his shoulder. 

“Leave her alone for a minute,” she said. 

Charlie leaned over the trunk, propping her chin on her 
hands. What am | missing, Dad? She stood up straight and 
stretched her arms over her head, turning her whole body 
Slowly to study her surroundings. 

There was an empty lot beyond the development, not far 
from where they were. It was marked out with telephone 
poles, only one of which had wires. A breeze dragged the 
loose wires through the dirt, scattering gravel. It didn’t look 
like it had ever been paved. There was a coil of barbed wire 
as tall as Charlie, sitting uselessly in a corner. Empty cans 
and fast-food wrappers littered the ground, the paper 
quivering and the cans rattling in the slight wind, like they 
sensed something awful. The wind rushed up behind Charlie 
and blew past her, straight toward the field, rustling the 


papers and cans and sending waves across the patches of 
brown grass. Something wrong is planted there. 

Filled with a new energy, Charlie opened the car door just 
enough to lean inside. 

“That lot. We have to go look.” 

“What do you see? It’s kind of out of the way,” John said. 

Charlie nodded. “You said it yourself. If an eight-foot 
monster is digging up the neighbor’s backyard, someone’s 
going to notice. Besides, | just have ... | have a feeling.” 

Jessica got out of the car and John followed at her heels. 
Charlie already had the trunk open. She pulled out a shovel, 
the big Maglite flashlight she always kept close by, anda 
crowbar. 

“I’ve only got one shovel,” she explained, making it clear 
she was keeping it for herself. Jessica took the flashlight and 
made a practice swing with it, as if hitting an invisible 
assailant. 

“Why would you even have a shovel?” Jessica asked ina 
Suspicious tone. 

“Aunt Jen,” John said by way of explanation. 

Jessica laughed. “Well, you never know when you might 
have to dig up a robot.” 

“Come on,” Charlie said, tossing John the crowbar and 
starting off. He caught it with ease and jogged beside her, 
leaning in so Jessica wouldn’t hear. 

“How come | don’t get the shovel?” 

“| figure you can swing a crowbar harder than | can,” 
Charlie said. 

He grinned. “Makes sense,” he said confidently, gripping 
the crowbar with new purpose. 

When they reached the edge of the lot, John and Jessica 
stopped, looking down at the ground before them, as 


though scared of what they might step on. Charlie went 
ahead across the loose dirt, gripping the shovel tightly. The 
field was mostly barren soil, studded with large mounds of 
gravel and dirt that had been left for so long that grass had 
begun growing on them. 

“This must have been the dumping ground for when they 
were building,” John said. He took a few steps into the lot, 
avoiding a broken glass bottle. 

At the opposite edge was the tree line. Charlie studied it 
carefully, tracking its path back in the direction they’d 
come. 

John knelt beside a pile of gravel and carefully poked at it 
with his crowbar, as though something might leap out. 
Jessica had wandered toward a cluster of bushes. She 
crouched to pick something up, then quickly dropped it and 
wiped her hands on her shirt. “Charlie, this place is 
disgusting!” she cried. 

Charlie had reached the tree line and began walking 
alongside it, studying the ground. 

“See anything?” John yelled from the other side of the 
lot. 

Charlie ignored him. Deep grooves in the dirt extended 
from the trees, snaking around the bushes. The large rocks 
nearby were freshly marked with gashes and scrapes. “Not 
exactly footprints,” Charlie whispered as she followed the 
grooves in the soil. Her foot touched soft ground, a sudden 
contrast to the hard-packed dirt of the rest of the lot. She 
stepped back. The dirt at her feet was discolored, familiar. 

Charlie struck her shovel into the ground and started to 
dig, the metal rasping noisily on the gravel mixed in with 
the dirt. Jessica and John ran toward her. 


“Careful,” John warned as he approached. He hefted the 
crowbar in his hands like a baseball bat, ready to strike. 
Jessica hung back. Charlie saw that her knuckles were white 
on the flashlight’s handle, but her face was calm and 
determined. The dirt was loose and came away easily. At 
last the blade of the shovel struck metal with a hollow c/unk, 
and they all jumped. Charlie handed the shovel to John and 
knelt in the mess of scattered earth, brushing away the dirt 
with her hands. 

“Careful!” Jessica said, her voice higher-pitched than 
usual, and John echoed her. 

“This was a horrible idea,” he murmured, scouting the 
area. “Where’s a police car when you need one? Or any 
car?” 

“It’s still day for a little while longer,” Charlie said 
absently, focused on the ground as her hands ran through it, 
prying away rocks and clods of dirt, digging to find what lay 
beneath. 

“Yeah, it’s day. It was also day when that twisted Foxy 
attacked you earlier, remember?” John said more urgently. 

“Wait, WHAT?” Jessica exclaimed. “Charlie, get away 
from there! You didn’t tell me that!” She turned on John 
accusingly. 

“Look, a LOT has been going on, okay?” John raised his 
hands, palms out. 

“Yeah, but if you’re going to sign me up for this stuff, 
then you need to tell me about things like that! You were 
attacked?” 

“Sign you up for this? You had one foot in the car at the 
first mention of murder! You practically invited yourself.” 

“Invited myself? You talk like | crashed your date, but you 
didn’t exactly fall over yourself to refuse my help.” Jessica 


planted her hands on her hips. 

“Charlie,” John sighed. “Can you please talk to—OH 
JEEZ.” He jumped backward, and Jessica followed suit as 
soon as she looked down. Beneath them, gazing up from the 
loose dirt, was an enormous metal face, staring toward the 
sun. Charlie didn’t say anything. She was still busy scooping 
away the soil from the edges, revealing two rounded ears on 
the sides of its head. 

“Charlie. Is that ... Freddy?” Jessica gasped. 

“| don’t know. | think it was supposed to be.” Charlie 
heard the anxiety in her own voice as she stared down at 
the large, lifeless bear with its perpetual smile. The crude 
metal frame was covered with a layer of gelatinous plastic, 
giving it an organic appearance, almost embryonic. 

“It’s huge.” John gasped. “And there’s no fur ...” 

“Just like the other Foxy.” Charlie’s hands were getting 
sore. She cleared the hair from her face and stood up. 

It was Freddy, but somehow not. The bear’s eyes were 
open, glazed over with the inanimate look of lifelessness 
Charlie knew so well. This bear was dormant, for now. 

“Charlie, we have to go,” John said with a tone of 
warning. But he didn’t move, still staring downward. He 
knelt beside the face and began to claw at the dirt above its 
forehead, clearing the earth away until he saw it: a filthy, 
battered black top hat. Charlie felt a smile tugging at her 
mouth, and she bit her lip. 

“We should call Burke,” Jessica said. “Now.” 

They all turned back toward the development as the wind 
rose again, rushing past them and making waves in the tall 
grass. The earth was still, and the sun was sinking lower 
behind the rolling hills in the distance. 





Charlie tossed her keys to John. “You go. There’s a gas 
station a few miles back the way we came. You can call from 
there.” He nodded, jangling the keys in his hand. 

“I'll stay with you,” Jessica said instantly. 

“No,” Charlie said, more forcefully than she intended. 
“Go with John.” Jessica looked confused for a moment but 
finally nodded and headed off toward the car. 

“Are you sure?” John asked. Charlie waved her hand at 
him dismissively. 

“Someone needs to stay with it. I'll keep my distance. | 
promise. | won’t disturb ... it.” 

“Okay.” Like Jessica, John hesitated for a moment. Then 
they left Charlie alone in the empty lot. After a minute, she 
heard the engine start, and the noise of the car faded as 
they drove off down the empty streets. She sat at the top of 


the mound where she had uncovered the misshapen bear 
and gazed down at it. 

“What do you know?” she whispered. She stood and 
paced slowly over the other two plots of disturbed soil, 
wondering what lay beneath. The bear was frightening, 
misshapen, an imitation of Freddy created by someone else. 
It was a strange variation, into which her father had never 
breathed life. But William Afton—Dave—did. The man who 
designed these things was the same man who had stolen 
and murdered her brother. 

A thought surfaced, a question that had visited her many 
times before: Why did he take Sammy? Charlie had asked 
herself, the wind, and her dreams that question endlessly. 
Why did he take Sammy? But she had always meant, Why 
not me? Why was | the one who lived? She stared down at 
the soil beneath her, envisioning the bear’s strange, 
embryonic face. The children murdered at Freddy Fazbear’s 
had lived on after death, their spirits lodged somehow inside 
the animatronic costumes that had killed them. Could 
Sammy’s spirit be imprisoned somehow, behind a large, 
rectangular door? 

Charlie shivered and stood up, suddenly wanting to put 
as much distance as possible between her and the twisted 
Freddy buried in the soil. The image of his face came to her 
again, and this time it made her skin crawl. Did the other 
two mounds hide similar creatures? Was there a malformed 
rabbit hidden in the dirt just there? A chicken clutching a 
cupcake to its grotesque chest? But the thing that tried to 
kill me—tried to envelop me—it was designed to kill. There 
could be anything buried down there, waiting for nightfall. 
She could look, dig up the other two mounds to see what lay 
slumbering beneath. But as soon as she thought it she could 


almost feel the lock of metal hands on her arms, forcing her 
inside that deathly, cavernous chest. 

Charlie took a few deliberate steps back from the 
mounds, wishing just a little that she had allowed Jessica to 
Stay.

“How has your visit with Charlie been?” Jessica asked ina 
conspiratorial tone as they made the final turn out of the 
development and onto the main road. 

John didn’t take his eyes off the road. “It’s been fun to 
see her again. You, too,” he added, and she laughed. 

“Yes, you've always loved me. Don’t worry, | Know you’re 
here to see her.” 

“I’m here for a job, actually.” 

“Right,” Jessica said. She turned and looked out the 
window. “Do you think Charlie’s changed?” she asked 
abruptly. 

John was silent for a moment, picturing the bedroom 
Charlie had turned into a scrap heap and Theodore, ripped 
apart and strewn in pieces. He thought of her tendency to 
retreat into herself, losing whole minutes as if she were 
stepping briefly out of time. Do | think she’s changed? 

“No,” he said finally. 

“I! don’t think she has, either.” Jessica sighed. 

“What did you find at Freddy’s?” John asked. 

“Dave,” Jessica said plainly, waiting for a moment before 
looking at John. “Right where we left him.” 

“And you’re sure he was dead?” John looked down. 

Jessica swallowed hard, suddenly seeing the body again. 
She pictured the discolored skin and the costume that had 


sunken into his rotting flesh, fusing the man to the mascot 
in a grotesque eternity. 

“He was dead all right,” she said hoarsely. 

The gas station was just up ahead. John parked in the 
small lot and got out of the car without waiting for Jessica. 
She followed at his heels. 

“What a dump.” Jessica spun, marveling at the 
Surroundings. “Surely there was a better place to ...” Jessica 
stopped short, suddenly seeing the teenage boy behind the 
counter. He was staring into space, watching something just 
behind them and to the left. 

“Excuse me,” John said. “Do you have a public phone?” 
The boy shook his head. 

“No, not public,” he said, gesturing to it. 

“Could we use it? Please?” 

“Customers only.” 

“I'll pay for the call,” John said. “Look, this is important.” 
The boy looked at them, his eyes finally focusing, as if only 
just registering their presence. He nodded slowly. 

“Okay, but you have to buy something while she makes 
the call.” He shrugged, helpless against the rules of 
management. 

“John, just give me the number,” Jessica said. He dug it 
out of his pocket and handed it to her. As she went behind 
the counter, John scanned the shelves impatiently, looking 
for the cheapest item available. 

“We have Popsicles,” the kid said. 

“No, thanks,” John said. 

“They're free.” He pointed at the cooler. 

“Well, how’s that going to help me if they’re free?” 

“I'll let it count as a purchase.” The boy winked. 


John clenched his jaw and lifted the lid of the cooler, 
jerking slightly at the sight of the taxidermy coyote hidden 
inside. 

“Brilliant. Did you stuff that yourself?” he asked loudly. 

The boy laughed, a sudden, snorting sound. “Hey!” he 
yelled as John grabbed the carcass by the head and yanked 
it out of the cooler. “Hey! You can’t do that!” John marched 
to the door, out into the parking lot, and hurled the dead 
thing into the road. “Hey!” The boy screamed again and ran 
out into the street, disappearing into a cloud of dust. 

“John?” Jessica hurried out from around the counter. 
“Clay’s on his way.” 

“Great.” He followed her out to the car.

Charlie was still walking in circles, glancing up at the horizon 
every few seconds. She felt like a sentry, or the keeper of a 
vigil. She couldn’t stop imagining the animatronics buried 
there, whatever they were. They weren’t in boxes, not even 
Shielded from the dirt; it would sink into their every pore 
and joint, it would fill them. They could open their mouths to 
scream, but the relentless dirt would just flow in, too fast for 
sound to escape. 

Charlie shivered and rubbed her arms, looking up at the 
Sky. It was turning orange, and shadows from the weeds 
began stretching out across the ground. Giving the mounds 
a sideways glance, she walked with deliberate steps to the 
other side of the lot where the only telephone pole with 
wires stood. They hung down from it like the branches of a 
weeping willow, dragging in the dirt. As Charlie got closer 
she saw small, dark shapes by its base. She approached 


Slowly: they were rats, all lying stiff and dead. She stared 
down at them for a long moment, then whirled, startled, at 
the sounds of cars. 

John and Jessica had returned, and Clay was just behind 
them. He must have already been in the area. 

“Watch out for that pole,” Charlie said by way of 
greeting. “I think the wires are live.” 

John laughed. “No one touch the wires. Glad you’re 
Okay.” 

Clay didn’t speak; he was busy examining the patches of 
dirt. He walked around them as Charlie had, peering at them 
from every angle, then finally came to a stop when he’d 
made a full circle. “You dug one of these up?” he asked, and 
Charlie could hear the strain behind his level voice. 

“No,” John said hastily. “We just uncovered part of it, 
then covered it back up.” 

Clay looked down again. “I’m not sure if that makes it 
better or worse,” he said, his eyes still on the mounds. 

“It looked like Freddy,” Charlie said urgently. “It looked 
like a strange, misshapen Freddy. There was something 
wrong with it.” 

“What was wrong?” Clay asked gently. He looked at her 
with serious eyes. 

“1 don’t know,” Charlie said helplessly. “But there’s 
something wrong with all of them.” 

“Well, they’re murdering people,” Jessica offered. “I'd 
count that as something being wrong with them.” 

“Charlie,” Clay said, still focused on her, “If you can tell 
me anything else about these things, then now’s the time. 
We have to assume that, as Jessica told me over the phone, 
they’re going to kill again tonight.” 


Charlie dropped to her knees in the place where they had 
dug up the twisted Freddy, and began digging again. 

“What are you doing?” John protested. 

“Clay needs to see it,” she muttered. 

“What in the ...” Clay inched forward to study the face, 
then took a long step back to observe the disturbed plots of 
earth, measuring the size of the things buried at their feet. 

“We have to evacuate these buildings,” John said. 
“Otherwise, what are we going to do when these things get 
up? Ask them to go back to bed? There aren’t that many 
apartments in this area that actually have people living in 
them. There’s only one building in the whole block,” he said, 
pointing, “maybe two, that looked occupied.” 

“Okay, I’m going to go check it out and see who’s home. 
Keep watch over these things.” Clay studied the row of 
buildings and made his way toward them. 

“So we wait,” John said. 

Charlie continued watching the skyline. Dark clouds were 
rolling over the sun, making it appear as though night had 
fallen early. 

“Do you hear that?” Jessica whispered. 

Charlie knelt beside the metal face half-buried in the 
ground and turned her ear to it. “Charlie!” John startled. She 
lifted her head and stared at the face again. It had changed 
from one moment to the next. Its features had smoothed 
over, become less crude. She looked up at John, her eyes 
wide. “It’s changing.” 

“Wait, what? What does that mean?” Jessica said, looking 
horrified. 

“It means something is very wrong,” he said. Jessica 
waited for him to explain. 

“We're not at Freddy’s anymore,” was all he offered. 


Clay returned from across the field. 

“Everyone into the car,” he said. 

“My car?” Charlie asked. 

Clay shook his head. “Mine.” Charlie was about to 
protest, but Clay gave her a stern look. “Charlie, unless your 
car has a siren and you've had high-speed pursuit training, 
stand down.” She nodded. 

“What did you tell them?” Jessica asked suddenly. 

“| told them there was a gas leak in the area,” Clay said. 
“Scary enough to get them out, not so scary as to start a 
panic.” Jessica nodded. She looked almost impressed, like 
she was taking mental notes. 

They piled into Clay’s car, Jessica quickly claiming the 
front seat, though Charlie suspected that she just wanted to 
leave her alone next to John. The cruiser sat at the edge of 
the lot, as far from the mounds as they could be without 
edging onto the road. As the sun sank below the horizon 
and the final streaks of light bled away into darkness, a 
single streetlight flickered on. It was old, the light almost 
orange, and it sputtered at intervals, as if it might fail at any 
moment. Charlie watched it for a while, empathizing. 

John was busy staring out across the field, unblinking, but 
as the hour passed he began to slouch in his seat. He let out 
a yawn, then quickly brought himself back to alertness. An 
elbow poked him in the ribs and he turned to find Charlie 
with a mess of wires in her lap, studying something 
carefully. “What are you doing?” he asked, then turned his 
gaze back to the field. 

“I’m trying to see what exactly this thing does.” Charlie 
had the metal disc firmly in her hand. It was the one they’d 
wrestled from the monster that day. She was trying to 


connect it properly to the diagnostic tool’s small keypad and 
display. 

“Okay, John, don’t puke on me.” She smiled, her finger 
ready to flick the switch. 

“I'll do my best,” he grumbled and tried to concentrate 
on the dimly lit field. 

“What is that?” Jessica whispered. 

“We found it inside the animatronic that attacked us 
today,” Charlie was eager to explain. Jessica leaned in 
closer to see. “It emits some kind of signal; we don’t know 
what it is.” 

“It changes what those things look like.” John turned his 
head from the window with a nauseated look. 

“It changes our perception of what they look like,” 
Charlie corrected. 

“How?” Jessica seemed captivated. 

“I’m not sure yet, but maybe we can find out.” Charlie 
dug her nail into the groove and pulled the switch. “Ugh, | 
can hear it already.” 

John sighed. “And | can feel it.” 

“I can’t...” Jessica tilted her head to listen. “Maybe | can. 
| don’t know.” 

“It’s very high-pitched.” Charlie was busy turning small 
knobs on the handheld display, trying to get a readout from 
the device. 

“It gets into your head.” John rubbed his forehead. “This 
morning it almost made me sick.” 

“Of course,” Charlie whispered. “It gets into your head.” 

“What?” Jessica turned toward her. 

“These readings looked nonsensical at first. | thought 
something was wrong.” 


“And?” John said impatiently when Charlie suddenly went 
silent. 

“In class we learned that when the brain is 
overstimulated, it fills in gaps for you. So, say you pass a 
red hexagonal sign on the road, and someone asks you 
what words were on it. You’d say ‘STOP.’ And you’d imagine 
that you saw it. You’d be able to picture that stop sign the 
way it should have been. That is, of course, if you were 
properly distracted and didn’t notice an obviously blank 
sign. This thing distracts us. Somehow it makes our brains 
fill in blanks with previous experiences, the things we think 
we should be seeing.” 

“How does it do that? What’s in the actual signal?” John 
glanced back again, only half listening. 

“It’s a pattern. Sort of.” Charlie leaned back, letting her 
arms relax, the device cradled in her hands. “The disc emits 
five sound waves that continuously vary in frequency. First 
they match one another, then they don’t; they go in and out 
of harmony, always on the edge of forming a predictable 
sequence, then branching away.” 

“I! don’t understand. So, it’s nota pattern?” John said. 

“It’s not, but that’s the whole point. It almost makes 
sense, but not quite.” Charlie paused, thinking for a 
moment. “The tone fluctuations happen so fast that they’re 
only detected by your subconscious. Your mind goes mad 
trying to make sense of it; it’s immediately overwhelmed. 
It’s like the opposite of white noise: you can’t follow it, and 
you can’t tune it out.” 

“So the animatronics aren’t changing shape. We’re just 
being distracted. What’s the purpose of that, though?” John 
had turned away from the window, giving up the pretense of 
ignoring the conversation. 


“To earn our trust. To look more friendly. To look more 
real.” As the possibilities stacked up, a grim picture began 
to form in Charlie’s mind. 

John laughed. “To look more real, maybe. But they 
certainly don’t strike me as friendly.” 

“To lure kids closer,” Charlie continued. The car got quiet. 
“Let’s just focus on getting through the night, okay?” 
Clay said from the front seat. “I can’t call this in as is. Right 

now it’s just buried junk in a field. But if you’re right, and 
something starts moving out there ...” He didn’t finish. John 
leaned against the car door, propping his head against the 
window so he could keep watching. 

Charlie leaned her head back, letting her eyes close for 
just a few moments. Across the field, the orange bulb 
continued to flicker with a hypnotic pulse.

Minutes passed, and then almost another hour. Clay glanced 
at the teenagers. They had all fallen asleep. Charlie and 
John were awkwardly leaning on each other. Jessica had 
curled up with her feet on the seat beneath her and her 
head resting on the narrow window ledge. She looked like a 
cat, or a human who was going to wake up with neck 
problems. Clay shrugged his shoulders up and down, seized 
with the odd alertness he always felt when he was the only 
one awake. When Carlton had been a baby, he and Betty 
would take turns getting up with him. But while Betty had 
been exhausted by it, barely making it through the following 
day, Clay had found himself almost energized. There was 
something about walking through the world when no one 
else was stirring. It made him feel as if he could protect 


them all, as if he could make everything all right. Oh, Betty. 
He blinked, the orange streetlight suddenly shimmering as 
his eyes moistened. He took a deep breath, regaining 
control. There was nothing | could say, was there? 
Unbidden, the memory of their last conversation—their last 
fight—reared in his mind. 

“All hours of the night. It’s not healthy. You’re obsessed!” 

“You're as consumed by your work as / am. It’s 
something we have in common, remember? Something we 
love about each other.” 

“This is different, Clay. This worries me.” 

“You're being irrational.” 

She laughed, a sound like breaking glass. “If you think 
that, then we’re not living in the same reality.” 

“Maybe we’re not.” 

“Maybe not.” 

The light changed. Clay glanced around, fully focused on 
the present again. The orange streetlight was fading, the 
flickering growing faster. As he watched, it gave a final 
heroic burst and went dark. 

“Damn it,” he said aloud. Jessica stirred in her sleep, 
making a small protesting noise. Quietly, but quickly, Clay 
exited the car, grabbing the flashlight from its place beside 
his seat. He closed the door and started toward the mounds, 
his frantic light shaking out across the field until it 
disappeared. 

Charlie roused. Her heart was racing, but she couldn’t tell 
if it was from the sudden awakening, or from the remnants 
of a dream she could no longer recall. She shook John. 

“John, Jessica. Something’s going on.” Charlie was out of 
the car and running before they could answer, heading 


toward the mounds. “Clay!” she called. He jumped at the 
sound of her voice. 

“They're gone.” Charlie gasped, stumbling on the 
upturned earth. Clay was already running toward the 
apartment nearest him. “Go back to the car,” he barked 
over his shoulder. Charlie ran after him, glancing back, 
trying to spot John and Jessica. Charlie’s eyes weren’t 
adjusted yet and Clay’s flashlight seemed to sink into the 
darkness ahead of him. Charlie could only follow the sounds 
of his footsteps as he charged through the shallow grass. 

She finally came to a brick wall and sprinted around it to 
the front of the apartment. Clay was at the door already. He 
banged against it and impatiently peered into the nearest 
window. No one answered; no one was inside. 

A scream cut through the night, and Charlie froze. It was 
high-pitched and human, reverberating off the walls of the 
houses. It came again. Clay aimed his light in the direction 
of the sound. 

“We missed someone!” he shouted. He darted around 
the side of the house, running blindly back across the field. 
The scream seemed to be in motion, making its way rapidly 
toward the black trees. 

“Over here!” Charlie cried, breaking from behind Clay 
and running toward an indistinct movement in the dark. 

“Charlie!” John’s voice cut distantly through the night, 
but Charlie didn’t wait for him. The sound of gravel under 
her feet was deafening. She came to an abrupt stop, 
realizing she’d lost her bearings. “Charlie!” someone yelled 
in the distance. The rest was lost in the rustle of the trees as 
a night wind swept through. She tried to keep her eyes open 
as grains of sand pelted her face. Then the wind finally 
calmed, and there was another rustle of branches nearby, 


this one unnatural. Charlie stumbled toward the sound, 
holding her arms in front of her until she could see again. 

Then it was there. Just at the edge of the tree line, a 
misshapen figure stood hunched in the darkness. Charlie 
stopped short a few yards away, struck still, suddenly aware 
that she was alone. The thing lurched to the side, then 
stepped toward her, revealing a sleek snout. A wolf’s mane 
ran over the top of its head and down its back. It was 
stooped over, one arm twisted downward while the other 
flailed up. Perhaps its control over its limbs was uncertain. It 
was looking at Charlie, and she met its eyes: they were 
piercing blue and self-illuminating. Yet while the eyes held a 
steady light, the rest of the creature was in flux, morphing in 
a disorienting fashion even as she watched. One moment it 
was a groomed and agile figure covered in silver hair, the 
next a tattered metal framework, partly coated in rubbery 
translucent skin. Its eyes were stark white bulbs. The 
creature flinched and convulsed, finally settling on its crude 
metal appearance. Charlie drew in a sharp breath, and the 
wolf broke its stare. 

It soasmed alarmingly, doubling over. Its chest split open, 
folding outward like a horrid metal mouth. The parts made a 
grinding, abrasive sound. Charlie stifled a scream, rooted to 
the spot. It lurched again, and something fell from inside it, 
landing solidly on the ground. The wolf toppled forward 
beside it, shuddered, and went still. 

“Oh no.” Clay arrived from behind Charlie, staring at the 
human body that lay writhing in the grass. 

Charlie remained motionless, captivated by the wolfish 
pinpoints of light that stared back at her. The thing tucked 
its head down, suddenly flowing again with a silver mane. It 
folded its long, silken ears, and slunk backward, 


disappearing into the woods. There was a rustling in the 
trees, and then it was gone. 

No sooner had Jessica arrived than Clay was forcefully 
shoving the light into her hands. “Take it!” Clay knelt by the 
body doubled over in the grass and checked for a pulse. 
“She’s alive,” he said, but his voice was hard. He bent over 
her, looking for something else. 

“Charlie!” It was John, tugging at her shoulder. “Charlie, 
come on, we have to get help!” 

John took off running and Charlie followed more slowly, 
unable to take her eyes off the woman who seemed to be 
dying on the ground. Clay’s voice faded into the darkness 
behind them. 

“Miss, are you all right? Miss? Can you hear me?” 





Professor Treadwell seemed restless. Her face was calm as 
ever, but as the students worked, she paced back and forth 
across the auditorium stage, the heels of her shoes making 
a repetitive click. Arty poked Charlie, nodded toward the 
professor, and quickly mimed screaming. Charlie smiled and 
turned back to her own work. She didn’t mind the sound. 
The professor’s sharp, regular steps were like a metronome, 
marking the time. 

She reread the first question: Describe the difference 
between a conditional loop and an infinite loop. Charlie 
sighed. She knew the answer; it just seemed pointless to 
write it down. A conditional loop happens only when certain 
conditions she started, then scratched it out and sighed 
again, staring out over the heads of the other students. 


She could see the face of the wolf again, shimmering 
back and forth between its two faces: the illusion and the 
frame beneath it. Its eyes stared into her own, as if reading 
something deep inside her. Who are you? Who were you 
supposed to be? she thought. She had never seen it before, 
and it worried her. Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza didn’t have a wolf. 

Charlie had a near-photographic memory, she’d realized 
last year. It was the reason she had such recall of even her 
early childhood. But she didn’t remember the wolf. That’s 
silly, she told herself. There’s plenty you don’t remember. 
And yet her memories of her father’s workshop were so 
strong: the smell, the heat. Her father bent over his 
workbench, and the place in the corner where she didn’t like 
to look. It was all so present within her, so immediate. Even 
the things she didn’t remember without prompting, like the 
old Fredbear’s Family Diner, had been instantly familiar as 
soon as she’d seen them. Yet these creatures had no 
foothold in her memory. She didn’t know them, but they 
clearly knew her. 

Why were they entombed in the back of the house like 
that? Why not just destroyed? Her father’s deep attachment 
to his creations had never outweighed his pragmatism. If 
something didn’t work, he dismantled it for parts. He had 
done the same with Charlie’s own toys. 

She blinked, suddenly recalling. 

He held it out to her, a little green frog with horn-rimmed 
glasses over its bulging eyes. Charlie looked at it skeptically. 

“No,” she said. 

“Don’t you want to see what he does?” her father 
protested, and she crossed her arms and shook her head. 

“No,” she mumbled. “I don’t like the big eyes.” Despite 
her protests, her father set the frog on the ground in front of 


her and pressed a button hidden beneath the plastic at its 
neck. It rotated its head from side to side, then suddenly 
leaped in the air. Charlie screamed and jumped back, and 
her father rushed to pick her up. 

“I’m sorry, sweetheart. It’s okay,” he whispered. “I didn’t 
mean for it to startle you.” 

“| don’t like the eyes,” she sobbed against his neck, and 
he held her for a long moment. Then set her down and 
picked up the frog. He put it on his workbench, took a short 
knife from the shelf, and sliced its skin along its entire 
length. Charlie clapped a hand over her mouth and made a 
small, squeaking sound, watching wide-eyed as he 
carelessly peeled the green casing off the robot. The plastic 
split with a loud cracking noise in the quiet workshop. The 
frog’s legs kicked helplessly. 

“I didn’t mean it,” she said hoarsely. “I’m sorry, | didn’t 
mean it! Daddy!” She was speaking aloud, but it was mostly 
air. Her voice was somehow constrained, like in dreams 
where she tried to scream, but nothing came out. Her father 
was intent on his work and didn’t seem to hear her. 

The stripped-down robot lay prone before him on the 
bench. He prodded it and it made a horrible twitch, its back 
legs kicking out uselessly, repeating the motion of its leap 
into the air. It tried again, more frantically, like it was in 
pain. 

“Wait. Daddy, don’t hurt him,” Charlie mouthed, trying 
and failing to force out the sound. Her father selected a tiny 
screwdriver and began to work at the frog’s head, deftly 
unscrewing something on each side. He removed the back 
of the skull to reach inside. Its whole body convulsed. 
Charlie ran to her father’s side and grabbed his leg, tugging 


at the knee of his pants. “Please!” she cried, her voice 
returning. 

He disconnected something, and the skeleton went 
completely limp. Joints that had been stiff collapsed into a 
slump of parts. The eyes, which Charlie had not even 
noticed were lit, dimmed, flickered, and went dark. She let 
go of her father and moved back into the recess of the 
workshop, putting both hands over her mouth again so that 
he would not hear her cry as he began to methodically 
dismantle the frog. 

Charlie shook her head, pulling herself back to the 
present. The child’s guilt still clung to her, like a weight in 
her chest. She gently pressed her hand there. My father was 
pragmatic, she thought. Parts were expensive, and he didn’t 
waste them on things that didn’t work. She forced her mind 
to the problem at hand. 

So why would he have buried them alive? 

“Buried who alive?” Arty hissed, and she turned, startled. 

“Shouldn’t you be busy doing something?” she said 
hastily, mortified to have spoken aloud. 

The creatures had been buried in a chamber like a 
mausoleum, hidden in the walls of the house. Her father 
hadn’t wanted to destroy them for some reason, and he had 
wanted them nearby. Why? So he could keep an eye on 
them? Or did he even know they were there? Did Dave 
somehow hide them there without his knowledge? She 
shook her head. It didn’t matter. What mattered was what 
the creatures were going to do next. 

She closed her eyes again, trying to envision the wolflike 
creature. She’d only seen it for that moment, as it disgorged 
the woman inside it and hovered between states, its illusion 
flickering like a faulty lightbulb. Charlie held on to the 


image, kept it frozen in her mind. She’d been fixated first on 
the victim, then on the wolf’s eyes, but she had still seen 
the rest of it. Now she pictured the scene, ignoring the 
wolf’s gaze, ignoring the panic that had seized her, the 
others shouting and running around her. She watched it 
happen again and again, picturing the chest sliding open 
one toothlike rib at a time, then the woman falling out. 

She realized she had a better picture of the same thing 
stored away: the creature in the tomb, just before it tried to 
swallow her. She visualized its chest opening, searching her 
mind to see what lay beyond the hideous mouth, inside the 
cavernous chest. Then she bent her head over her exam 
book and began to draw. 

“Time,” called one of the graduate students. The other 
three began to march up the aisles, collecting blue books 
one by one. Charlie only had half a sentence in answer to 
the first question, and it was crossed out—the rest of the 
book was a mess of mechanisms and monsters. Just before 
the teaching assistant reached her, she quietly tucked the 
book under her arm. She exited the row, blending in with 
the students who had already finished. She didn’t speak to 
anyone on the way out, drifting more than walking, focused 
on her own thoughts as her body carried her aimlessly down 
the familiar hallway. She found a bench and sat. She looked 
around at the passing students, chatting to one another or 
lost in thoughts of their own. It was as if a wall had risen up, 
circling only her, completely isolating her from everything 
around her. 

She opened her book again, to the page where she’d 
spent her test time scribbling. There, staring back at her, 
were the faces she understood: the faces of monsters and 
murderers, with blank eyes that pierced right through her, 


even from her own sketches. What are you trying to tell me? 
She stood, clenching her book, then took one last look at 
her surroundings. 

It felt as though she were saying good-bye to a chapter 
of her life, another passage that would become nothing 
more than a haunting memory. 

“Charlie,” John’s voice said from nearby. She glanced 
around, trying to find him through the thick flow of students 
exiting the building. 

She finally spotted him off to the side of the stairs. “Oh, 
hey,” she called and made her way over. “What are you 
doing here? Not that I’m not glad to see you, | just thought 
you had to work,” she added hastily, trying to settle the 
whirling thoughts in her head. 

“Clay called me. He tried your dorm, but you were here | 
guess. The woman we... from last night. She’s going to be 
okay. He said he went to the next area, the next spot on the 
map, and drove around.” John glanced at the crowd of 
students streaming past them and lowered his voice. “You 
know, the next place they’re going to—” 

“| know,” Charlie said quickly, forestalling the 
explanation. “What did he find?” 

“Well, it’s a lot of empty space and fields mostly. One plot 
for future development, but it’s vacant. He thinks we should 
focus on tomorrow instead. He has a plan.” Charlie looked at 
him blankly. 

“We're going to have to fight them,” he said at last. “We 
both know that. But it won’t be tonight.” 

Charlie nodded. “So what do we do tonight then?” she 
asked helplessly. 

“Dinner?” John suggested. 

“You can’t be serious.” Charlie’s tone dropped. 


“| know there’s a lot going on, but we still need to eat, 
right?” 

Charlie stared at the ground, collecting her thoughts. 
“Sure. Dinner.” She smiled. “This is all pretty awful. It might 
be nice to get my mind off it, even if just for an evening.” 

“Okay,” he said, and shifted awkwardly. “I’m going to run 
home and change then. | won’t be long.” 

“John, none of this has to involve you,” Charlie said softly. 
She gripped the straps of her backpack with both hands, as 
if they were tethering her to the ground. 

“What are you talking about?” John looked at her, his 
self-consciousness gone. 

“It doesn’t have to involve anybody. It’s me they’re 
looking for.” 

“We don’t know that for sure,” he said, and put a hand 
on her shoulder. “You have to get that out of your head fora 
while. You'll drive yourself crazy.” John smiled briefly, but he 
still looked worried. “Try to do something relaxing for a bit, 
take a nap or something. I'll see you for dinner, okay? Same 
restaurant at seven?” 

“Okay,” she echoed. He looked at her helplessly and 
gave a distressed smile, then turned and went.

Jessica was gone when Charlie got back to the dorm. She 
closed the door behind her with a sense of relief. She 
needed quiet. She needed to think, and she needed to 
move. She looked around, paralyzed for a moment. Her 
system of piling everything up as she used it was functional 
day-to-day, but when searching for something she hadn’t 
touched in weeks, the system broke down. 


“Where is it?” she muttered, scanning the room. Her 
eyes lit on Theodore’s head, lying tumbled up against the 
leg of her bed. She picked it up and brushed off the dust, 
stroking his long ears until they were clean, if matted and 
patchy. “You used to be so soft,” she told the rabbit’s head. 
She set it on the bed, propped up on her pillow. “I guess | 
did, too,” she added and sighed. 

“Have you seen my duffel bag?” she asked the 
dismembered toy. “Maybe under the bed?” She got down on 
her knees to check. It was there, all the way at the far side, 
crushed by a pile of books and clothing that had fallen 
through the space between the bed and the wall. Charlie 
wriggled under the bed until she could snag the strap, then 
dragged it out and set it on top. 

It was empty—she’d dumped out the contents as soon as 
she arrived, a harbinger of the messy habits to follow. She 
grabbed her toothbrush and toothpaste and zipped them 
into the bag’s side pocket. 

“| lied to John,” she said. “No, that’s not right. | let him lie 
to me. He has to know it’s me they’re coming for. We all do. 
And this isn’t going to stop.” She picked up clothing from 
what she thought was the clean pile, pulling out a T-shirt 
and jeans, socks and underwear, and shoving them 
emphatically into her bag as she spoke. “Why else would 
they be coming in this direction?” she asked the rabbit. “But 
... how would they even know?” She threw two textbooks 
into the bag and patted her pocket, reassuring herself that 
the disc and the diagnostic keyboard were there. She zipped 
up the bag and tilted her head, meeting Theodore’s plastic 
eyes. 

“It’s not just that,” she said. “This thing ...” She 
measured the disc in her hand and studied it anew. “It made 


John sick. But it sings a song to me.” She broke off, unsure 
of what that meant about her. “I don’t know if I’ve ever 
known anything with quite such certainty,” she said quietly. 
“But | have to do this. Afton made them. And Afton took 
Sammy. When | was with John, | could feel ... something in 
the house. It had to be him; it was like the missing part of 
me was there, closer than it had ever been. | just couldn’t 
quite reach it. And | think those monsters are the only things 
in the world that might have answers.” 

Theodore stared back at her, unmoved. 

“It’s me they want. No one else is going to die because of 
me.” She sighed. “At least | have you to protect me, right?” 
She slung the bag over her back and turned to go, then 
paused. She grabbed Theodore’s head by the ears and held 
him up to her own eye level. “I think today | need all the 
Support | can get,” she whispered. She shoved him into her 
bag, then hurried out of the dorm to her car. 

The map was in the glove compartment. Charlie took it 
out and spread it in front of her, glancing at it momentarily 
then putting it away with confidence. She drove slowly out 
of the lot. Though she passed people and other cars on her 
way, she felt as though she was just part of the background, 
unseen to the world. By the time she and her car slipped out 
of sight, she’d already be forgotten. 


* OK OX 


The sky was cloudy; it gave the world a sense of waiting. It 
seemed like Charlie had the road to herself, and 
peacefulness overtook her. She’d been preoccupied with 
isolation today, but the speed and openness were 
comforting. She didn’t feel alone. The tree line seemed to 


race across the field when she watched it from the window, 
an illusion made by the speeding car. She began to feel as 
though there were something in the woods matching her 
speed, darting through the blur of branches, a silent 
companion, someone coming to tell her everything that she 
ever wanted to know. /’m coming, she whispered. 

The street dwindled from a highway to a country road, 
then to a gravel path. It rose up a long hill, and as Charlie 
Slowly ascended, she could see clusters of houses and cars 
in distant, more populated areas. She turned a corner and 
left it all behind: there were no more houses, no more Cars. 
The rows of trees had been replaced with lines of stumps 
and piles of brush, accompanied by the occasional blank 
billboard that, presumably, would someday announce what 
was to come. Slabs of concrete and half-paved driveways 
interrupted the countryside, and an abandoned bulldozer 
sat in the distance. Charlie took Theodore’s head from her 
bag and set it on the passenger seat. 

“Stay alert,” she said. 

Then she saw it: a single ranch-style house stood at the 
center of it all, surrounded by bulldozed land and the bare 
rib cages of half-built houses jutting from the ground. It was 
out of place: painted, fenced, and even planted with flowers 
in the garden. That’s when it made sense. A show house. 

The road stopped a few yards into the development, 
replaced by worn-down tracks in the dirt where the 
machinery came in and out. Charlie slowed the car toa 
stop. “Even you can’t follow me this time,” she said to the 
rabbit’s head, then got out and closed the door, giving 
Theodore a smile through the window. 

Charlie walked the trail slowly. The hulking, unfinished 
frames of the houses seemed to watch her reproachfully as 


she trespassed. The gravel crunched under her feet in the 
silence. There wasn’t even a breeze; everything was still. 
She stopped when she reached higher ground and surveyed 
her surroundings for a moment. Everything was disturbed. 
Everything was upturned. She glanced above her as a single 
bird passed overhead, barely visible from its soaring height. 
Her eyes returned to the wasteland. “You're here 
somewhere, aren’t you?” 

At last she reached the lone finished house. It was set at 
the center of a neat square of perfectly trimmed grass, 
towering above its stooped, half-constructed neighbors. 
Charlie stared at the lawn for a moment before realizing 
that it must be fake, just like whatever furniture was inside. 

She didn’t try the door right away, instead going around 
to the backyard. It was laid out in a neat square of Astroturf, 
just like the front, but here the illusion had been ruined. 
Ragged strips of grass had been torn up. The place radiated 
a sense of distress, now eerily familiar. Charlie just stared 
for a moment, certainty pulsing through her. She clenched 
her jaw, then went back around to the front door. It opened 
easily, without even a whisper of sound, and Charlie went 
inside. 

It was dark in the house. She flipped a light switch 
experimentally, and it illuminated the whole place in an 
instant. A fully furnished living room greeted her, complete 
with leather chairs and a couch, and even candles on the 
fireplace mantle. She started to close the front door behind 
her, then hesitated, leaving it ajar. She walked farther into 
the living room, where there was an L-shaped couch and a 
wide-screen TV. /’m surprised it hasn’t been stolen, she 
thought. But when she went closer she saw why—it wasn’t 


real. There were no cords or cables coming from it. The 
whole place had a surreal quality, almost of mockery. 

She walked slowly into the dining room, her feet clapping 
against the polished hardwood floor. Inside was a beautiful, 
mahogany dining set. Charlie bent over to look at the 
underside of the table. “Balsa wood,” she said, grinning to 
herself. It was a light, airy wood, made for model airplanes, 
not furniture; she could probably lift the table over her head 
if she wanted to. Down a short hallway from the dining room 
was a kitchen with gleaming new appliances, or at least 
imitations of them. There was also a back door in the 
kitchen. She unlocked it and pushed it open halfway, leaning 
outside and looking again at the expansive, tortured 
landscape. There were several stone steps here, leading 
down into a small garden. She stepped back inside, being 
sure to leave the door hanging slightly open. 

There was a second long hall off the living room. This led 
to bedrooms and a small room fashioned into an office or 
den, complete with tall bookshelves, a desk, and an inbox 
tray full of empty file folders. Charlie sat down in the desk 
chair, finding herself enchanted by the utterly surface 
imitation of life. She spun the chair once, then stood again, 
not wanting to get distracted. There was a door to the 
outside here, too, though it was oddly placed beside the 
desk. Charlie opened it, fiddling with the latch until she was 
sure it would stay open. She continued on her way, walking 
through the house systematically, unlocking and opening 
each window she came to. Then she went down to the 
basement, where a storm cellar hung over a set of steep 
stone stairs. She opened that as well, leaving the doors 
gaping wide. Outside, dark had fallen. 


There were several bedrooms, each furnished and made 
up with bright curtains and silk sheets, and a large 
bathroom with marble sinks. Charlie turned the faucet to 
see if there was water, but nothing happened, not even the 
grinding of pipes trying and failing. There was a master 
bedroom with an enormous bed, a guest room that 
somehow looked even less lived-in than the rest of the 
house, and a nursery with a life-size menagerie painted on 
the wall and a mobile hanging above a crib. Charlie glanced 
inside each, then went back into the master bedroom. 

The bed was wide and covered in a light canopy of white 
mosquito netting. The covers were white as well, and the 
moon shone through the window to illuminate the pillows. It 
had an uncanny effect, as if whoever slept there would be 
on display. Charlie went to the window and leaned out, 
breathing in the soothing, cool night air. She looked up at 
the sky. It was still cloudy; there were only a few stars 
visible. She’d been moving with such grim, impulsive energy 
until now, but this part would be agonizing. Long hours 
might pass before anything happened, and all she could do 
was wait. A nervous fluttering had begun to fill her stomach. 
She wanted to pace, or even to run away, but she closed 
her eyes and clenched her jaw. /t’s me they want. 

At last, Charlie pulled herself away from the window. 
She’d packed pajamas in the bag out in the car, but this 
sterile house full of props and imitations felt too strange for 
her to actually dress for bed. Instead she just took off her 
Sneakers and considered her bedtime rituals complete. She 
laid down on the bed and tried to conjure her nightmares, 
gathering up those final moments with Sammy and holding 
them close to her like a talisman. Ho/d on, she thought. /’m 
coming.

John checked his watch. She’s just running late. But she was 
late last time, too. The waitress caught his eye, and he 
shook his head. Of course, last time she showed up covered 
in filth. He’d already called her dorm room, but the phone 
just rang and rang. He’d seen what he’d thought was an 
answering machine when he was there, but realized only as 
he was waiting for it to pick up that it could have been one 
of Charlie’s projects, or some piece of discarded junk. The 
waitress refilled his water glass, and he smiled at her. 

She shook her head. “Same girl?” she asked gently. 

John let out an involuntary laugh. “Yes, same girl,” he 
said. “But it’s okay. She’s not standing me up, she’s just... 
busy. College life, you know.” 

“Of course. Let me know if you want to order.” She gave 
him another look of pity and went away. He shook his head. 

Suddenly, he saw Charlie’s hands on her backpack 
straps, holding on so tight that her knuckles had gone white. 
They’re coming for me, she’d said. Charlie wasn’t the type 
to wait around patiently for something to happen to her. 

He got up and walked urgently to the pay phone at the 
back of the restaurant. Clay picked up on the first ring. 

“Clay, it’s John. Have you heard from Charlie?” 

“No. What’s wrong?” 

“Nothing,” John said reflexively. “I mean, | don’t know. 
She was supposed to meet me, and she’s—twenty-four 
minutes late. | know it’s not a lot, but she said something 
earlier that’s bothering me. | think she might do something 
stupid.” 

“Where are you?” John gave him the address. “I'll be 
right there,” Clay said and hung up before John could reply. 





For the first few minutes, Charlie kept her eyes shut, 
feigning sleep, but after a little while they began to flutter of 
their own accord. She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to 
force them to stay closed, but it became unbearable. She 
opened them into the darkness and at once felt relief. 

The house had grown cool with night. The open window 
let in fresh, clean air. She breathed deeply, trying with each 
exhalation to make herself calm. She wasn’t anxious so 
much as impatient. Hurry up, she thought. / know you're out 
there. 

But there was only silence, and stillness. 

She took the disc out of her pocket and looked at it. It 
was too dark to see any details, not that there was anything 
on it she hadn’t already memorized. A little light shone in 
from the moon outside, but the shadows in the corners were 


deep, like there was something hidden there eating up the 
light. She rubbed the side of the disc with her thumb, feeling 
the bumps of the letters. If she didn’t know they were there, 
they’d be scarcely noticeable. 

Afton Robotics, LLC. She’d seen pictures of William Afton, 
the man who Dave had been: pictures of him with her 
father, smiling and laughing. But she only remembered him 
as the man in the rabbit suit. My father must have trusted 
him. He must not have suspected. He would never have 
built a second restaurant with the man who murdered one 
of his children. But those creatures—he had to have known 
they were buried beneath our house. Charlie clenched her 
teeth, stifling a sudden delirious urge to smile. “Of course 
there was a secret robot graveyard under my bedroom,” she 
murmured. “Of course that’s where it would be.” She 
covered her face in her hands. All the threads were tangling 
in her mind. 

She pictured it unwillingly. The creature in the doorway. 
At first he was a shadow, blocking the light, then he was a 
man in a rabbit suit, and even then it didn’t occur to Charlie 
to be afraid. She knew this rabbit. Sammy hadn’t even 
noticed him yet. He continued to play with his toy truck, 
running it back and forth hypnotically across the floor. 
Charlie stared up at the thing in the doorway, and a 
coldness began to gather in the pit of her stomach. This was 
not the rabbit she knew. Its eyes shifted back and forth 
subtly between the twins, taking its time: making its choice. 
When the eyes settled on Charlie, the cold feeling spread all 
through her, then he looked away again, at Sammy, who 
still hadn’t turned around. Then a sudden movement, and 
the costumes on their hangers all leaped together, covering 
her so she couldn’t see. She heard the toy truck hit the 


ground and spin in place for a moment, then everything was 
still. 

She was alone, a vital part of her cut away. 

Charlie sat up, shaking herself to try and set the 
memories loose. She’d grown accustomed to sharing a room 
with Jessica. It was a long time since she’d been completely 
alone with her thoughts in the dark. 

“l forgot how hard it is to be quiet,” she whispered, her 
voice as soft as breath. She glared down at the strange disc 
in her hand, as if it was bringing these visions on her. She 
tossed it across the room and into a dark corner, out of 
sight. 

Then she heard it. Something was inside the house. 

Whatever it was, it was being cautious. She heard creaks 
from somewhere distant, but they were slow and muted. 
Silence followed; whatever moved was hoping the sound 
would be forgotten. Charlie crept from the bed and 
approached the door carefully, pushing it farther open and 
leaning out agonizingly slowly, until she could see deep into 
the living room, and the dining room beyond that. A part of 
her kept returning to the thought that she was in someone 
else’s house, that she was the intruder. 

“Hello?” she called, almost hoping for an answer, even 
an angry one demanding to know what she was doing there. 
Maybe John would answer, happy to have found her, and 
come running from the darkness. 

Only silence returned her call, but Charlie knew she 
wasn’t alone anymore. 

Her eyes widened, her heartbeat drumming in her throat, 
making it hard to breathe. She took careful steps over the 
stone tiles, down the short hall to just outside the living 
room, where she stood to listen again. A clock chimed the 


hours in a different room. Charlie walked to the edge of the 
living room and stopped again. She could see most of the 
house from here, and she scanned the area for anything out 
of place. Doorways surrounded her like gaping mouths, 
breathing night air from the windows she’d opened. 

There was a long hall leading from the farthest corner of 
the living room to a different bedroom. It was one of the few 
places she didn’t have a clear line of sight into. She edged 
around the leather sofa in front of her and across the 
circular rug that filled the room. As she walked, she could 
see more of the hall slowly revealing itself. It stretched out, 
farther and farther. 

Charlie stopped midstep. She could see into the far 
bedroom now. It was full of windows and blue moonlight, 
and there was something obstructing her view, something 
she hadn’t noticed while she was moving. Now its silhouette 
was unmistakable. Charlie carefully looked around again, 
her eyes adjusting to her surroundings. To her right, another 
large door led down a single step and into the large den. 
Bookcases stretched up to the ceiling, and a putrid air 
emanated from inside. Beyond the bookcases was another 
shadow that didn’t belong. Charlie bumped into a lamp and 
startled. She hadn’t even realized she was moving 
backward. 

The front door was open wide. Charlie nearly bolted 
toward it to escape, but she stopped herself. She took a 
breath and stepped softly back toward the bedroom, 
checking over her shoulder as she went. She went back to 
the bed, sliding her bare feet on the wood floor so her steps 
would make no sound, and eased herself slowly onto the 
mattress, cautious to keep the springs from creaking. 
Charlie lay back, closed her eyes, and waited. 


Her eyes twitched, every instinct she had shouting the 
same thing: Open your eyes! Run! Charlie breathed steadily 
in and out, trying to make her body go limp, trying to look 
asleep. Something is moving. She counted the steps. One, 
two, one, two—no. They were slightly asynchronous: there 
was more than one of them. Two, maybe all three, were 
inside the house. One set of footsteps passed her door, and 
She let her eyes flutter open for an instant, just in time to 
see an indistinct shadow cross before the crack in the door. 

Another set of footsteps sounded like they were in the 
side hallway, while a third ... 

She screwed her eyes shut tight. The steps fell still 
outside her door. Her breath was shuddering; she almost 
hiccupped as she inhaled and she bit her lips together. The 
door was gliding open. Her lungs tightened, pressing her for 
air, but she refused. She hung on to that single breath as if 
it were the last one she’d ever get. /’// find you. She 
clenched her fists, determined to remain still. 

The footsteps were through the door now, crossing the 
floor with a heavy tread. She kept still. The air above her 
stirred, and through her closed eyelids, the darkness grew 
even darker. Charlie opened her eyes, and breathed in. 

The space above her was empty; nothing was looking 
down at her. 

She turned her head slowly, peering into the open hall to 
her left. The noises had all stopped. 

Suddenly the blankets were yanked off her, pulled from 
the foot of the bed. Charlie shot up and finally saw what had 
come for her. An enormous head rested its chin at her feet. 
It looked like something from a carnival game, its eyes 
rolling from side to side, clicking each time they moved. A 
pitch-black top hat was perched on its head, cocked slightly 


to one side, and the giant cheeks and button nose gave him 
away immediately. Freddy. 

It was no longer the sleek and featureless head she had 
unearthed in the abandoned lot. His head was lively and full 
of movement, covered in wavy brown fur and bouncy 
cheeks. Yet there was something disjointed about it all, as 
though every part of his face was moving independently. 

Charlie fought to remain still, but her body was acting of 
its own accord, squirming and pulling to get away from the 
mouth opening up toward her. Freddy’s face slid across the 
bed like a python. His head lost its shape as it folded 
outward, taking hold of her feet and beginning to swallow, 
moving slowly upward as she fought not to scream or fight. 
A giant arm reached up and clapped the side of the bed, 
Shaking the room as it anchored itself and pulled the giant 
torso higher. Freddy’s jaw made motions of chewing as the 
distorted face pulled Charlie’s legs inside it. His cheeks and 
chin dislocating further. It no longer resembled a living 
thing. 

Panic took hold and Charlie screamed. She clenched her 
fists, but there was no longer a face to strike. There was 
only a squeezing and spiraling vortex of fur, teeth, and wire. 
Before she could struggle further, her arms were pinned to 
her side, trapped inside the thing. Only her head remained 
free. She gasped for a last breath, then was violently 
scooped up, consumed by the creature.

Clay Burke stopped the car without slowing down. The 
brakes screeched as they fishtailed in the dirt. John was out 


of the car before Clay had gotten it under control, running 
up the hill toward the house. 

“Around back,” Clay said, catching up to John, his voice 
low and tight. They made their way around the house to the 
back door, which was gaping open. “Check that way.” Clay 
gestured to his right as he ran left. John stuck close to the 
wall, peering into doorways as he passed them. 

“Charlie!” he cried. 

“Charlie!” Clay echoed, entering the master bedroom. 

“CHARLIE!” John ran from room to room, moving faster. 
“CHARLIE!” He arrived at the front door. He swung it wide 
open and stepped outside, half expecting to catch someone 
fleeing the scene. 

“Clay, did you find her?” he shouted as he raced back 
inside. 

Clay walked briskly back into the living room, shaking his 
head. “No, but she was here. The bed was unmade and 
there was dirt all over the floor. And these ...” He held up 
Charlie’s sneakers. John nodded grimly, only now noticing 
the trails of dirt strewn through the house. He glanced again 
to the front door. 

“She’s gone,” John said, his voice catching in his throat. 
He looked at the older man. “Now what?” he asked. 

Clay just stared at the floor, and said nothing. 





Clay!” John repeated. His alarm grew as the older man 
stared down at the dirty floorboards, apparently lost in 
thought. John put a hand on his arm, and Clay startled. He 
looked as if just he’d realized he wasn’t alone. “We have to 
find her,” John said urgently. 

Clay nodded, springing back to life. He broke into a run 
and John followed close at heel, barely making it into the 
passenger’s seat before Clay started the engine and took 
off, soeeding down the half-made road. 

“Where are we going?” John shouted. He was still 
struggling to close the door against the wind. It flapped like 
a massive wing, pulling against him as Clay swerved down 
the hill. Finally John yanked it shut. 

“| don’t know,” Clay said grimly. “But we know about how 
far they can get.” He drove wildly back down the hill and out 


to the main road, flipping on his police lights. They went less 
than a mile before he turned quickly onto a small, unpaved 
lane. 

John’s shoulder banged hard against the door. He gripped 
his seat belt as they barreled down the trail, high brush 
scraping the sides of the car and thumping the windshield. 

“They have to come through here,” Clay said. “This field 
is right in the middle of the path between that house and 
the next area on the map. We just have to wait for them.” 
He stopped the car abruptly and John jerked forward. 

Together they got out of the car. Clay had stopped at the 
edge of an open field. There were trees scattered here and 
there, and the grass was tall, but there were no crops, and 
no livestock grazed. John walked out into the open, watching 
the grass ripple like water in the wind. 

“You really think they’ll come by here?” John asked. 

“If they keep moving the direction they’ve been going,” 
Clay said. “They have to.” 

Long minutes passed. John paced back and forth in front 
of the car. Clay positioned himself closer to the middle of 
the field, ready to run in any direction at a moment’s notice. 

“They should have been here by now,” John said. 
“Something’s wrong.” He glanced at Clay, who nodded. 

The sound of a car engine rose from the distance, 
growing louder. They both froze. Whoever it was, they were 
coming fast; John could hear branches whipping against the 
car’s body in an irregular percussion. After a few seconds 
the car shot out from the lane and screeched to a halt. 

“Jessica.” John walked toward the car. 

“Where’s Charlie?” Jessica asked, stepping out onto the 
grass. 

“How did you find us?” Clay demanded. 


“| called her,” John put in quickly. “From the restaurant, 
right after | talked to you.” 

“I’ve been driving all over the place. I’m lucky | found 
you. Why are we stopped here?” 

“Their route crosses through here,” John explained, but 
she looked skeptical. 

“What does that mean? How do you know?” 

John glanced at Clay, neither of them looking confident. 

“They have her already, right?” Jessica said. “So why 
would they keep going toward her dorm?” Clay closed his 
eyes, putting a hand to his temples. 

“They wouldn’t,” he said. He looked up at the sky, the 
wind battering across his upturned face with a raw touch. 

“So they could be going anywhere now,” Jessica added. 

“We can’t predict what they’re doing anymore,” John 
said. “They got what they wanted.” 

“And she wanted this? She planned this?” Jessica said, 
her voice rising. “What’s wrong with you, Charlie?” She 
turned back to John. “They might not have even wanted her. 
It could have been anyone! So why did she have to go up 
there, like some kind of—of—” 

“Sacrifice,” John said quietly. 

“She can’t be dead,” Jessica muttered, her voice shaky 
even under her breath. 

“We can’t think like that,” John said sternly. 

“We'll form a perimeter,” Clay said. “Jessica, you and 
John take your car and start driving that way.” He pointed. 
“I'll loop back the other direction. We’ll make circles and 
hope we catch them. | can’t think of any other way.” He 
looked at the teenagers helplessly. No one moved, despite 
Clay’s new plan. John could feel it in the air; they had all 


surrendered. “I don’t know what else to do.” Clay’s voice 
had lost its strength. 

“| might,” John said abruptly, the idea forming even as he 
spoke. “Maybe we can ask them.” 

“You want to ask them?” Jessica said sarcastically. “Let’s 
call them and leave a message. ‘Please call us back with 
your murderous plot at your earliest convenience!’” 

“Exactly,” John said. “Clay, the mascots from Freddy’s: 
Are they a// gone? When you say you threw them out, what 
does that mean? Can we get access to them?” He turned to 
Jessica. “They helped us before, or at least they tried to, 
once they stopped trying to kill us. They might know 
something, | don’t know, even if they’re on a scrap heap 
somewhere, there must be something left. Clay?” 

Clay had turned his face up to the sky again. Jessica gave 
him a sharp look. “You know, don’t you?” she said. “You 
know where they are.” 

Clay sighed. “Yeah, | know where they are.” He hesitated. 
“| couldn’t let them be dismantled,” he went on. “Not 
knowing what they are, who they had been. And | didn’t 
dare let them be casually tossed out, considering what 
they’re capable of doing.” Jessica opened her mouth, about 
to ask a question, then stopped herself. “I... | kept them,” 
Clay said. There was a rare note of uncertainty in his voice. 

“You what?” John stepped forward, suddenly on guard. 

“| kept them. All of them. | don’t know about asking them 
any questions, though. Ever since that night, they haven’t 
moved an inch. They’re broken, or at least they’re doing a 
good impression of it. They’ve been sitting in my basement 
for over a year now. I’ve been careful to leave them alone. It 
just seemed like they shouldn’t be disturbed.” 


“Well, we have to disturb them,” Jessica said. “We have 
to try to find Charlie.” 

John scarcely heard her. He was staring searchingly at 
Clay. 

“Come on,” Clay said. He set off toward his car with a 
heavy look, as if something had just been taken from him. 

John and Jessica exchanged a glance, then followed. 
Before they reached Jessica’s car, Clay was already heading 
toward the main road. Jessica stepped on the gas, catching 
up just as Clay made a sharp right turn. 

They didn’t speak. Jessica was intent on the road, and 
John was slouched in his seat, thinking things through. 
Ahead of them, Clay had switched on his flashing lights, 
though he left off the siren. 

John stared into the darkness as they drove. Maybe he’d 
spot Charlie just by chance. He kept his hand loose on the 
door handle, ready to jump out, to run and save her. But 
there were only endless trees, scattered with the orange 
windows of distant houses, which hung on the hills like 
Christmas lights. 

“We're here,” Jessica said, sooner than John had 
expected. 

John pushed himself upright and peered out the window. 
She made a left turn and slowed the car down, and as 
She did John recognized it. A few yards ahead was Carlton’s 

house, surrounded by a cove of trees. Clay pulled into the 
driveway and they came in behind him. Jessica stopped the 
car inches from his bumper. 

Clay jangled his keys nervously as they approached the 
house; he looked like an altered man, no longer the assured 
police chief in control of every situation. He unlocked the 
door, but John hung back. He wanted Clay to go in first. 


Clay led them into the living room, and Jessica made a 
noise of surprise. Clay gave her a sheepish look. “Sorry for 
the mess,” he said. 

John glanced around. The room was mostly the same as 
he remembered, full of couches and chairs all fanned 
around a fireplace. But both couches were piled with open 
files and stacks of newspapers, and what looked like dirty 
laundry. Six coffee mugs sat crowded together on a single 
end table. John’s heart sank as he noticed two bottles of 
whiskey lying on their sides between an armchair and the 
hearth. He cast his eyes around quickly, spotting two more. 
One had rolled under a couch; the other was still half-full, 
sitting beside a glass with a distinct yellow tinge. John snuck 
a look at Jessica, who bit her lip. 

“What happened here?” she asked. 

“Betty left,” Clay said shortly. 

“Oh.” 

“I’m sorry,” John offered. Clay waved a hand at him, 
staving off further attempts at comfort. He cleared his 
throat. 

“She was right, | guess. Or at least she did what was 
right for her.” He forced a laugh and gestured at the mess 
that surrounded him. “We all do what we have to do.” He sat 
down in a green armchair, the only seat completely free of 
paperwork and debris, and shook his head. 

“Can | move these?” John asked, pointing to the papers 
that filled the couch opposite Clay. Clay didn’t respond, so 
John stacked them up and put them to one side, careful not 
to let anything fall. He sat, and after a moment so did 
Jessica, though she eyed the couch as if she thought it 
might be carrying the plague. 


“Clay—” John started, but the older man started talking 
again, as if he’d never stopped. 

“After all of you left—after all of you were safe—! went 
back for them. Betty and | had decided it might be a good 
time for Carlton to get out of town for a while, so she took 
him to stay with her sister for a few weeks. To be honest, | 
don’t remember if she suggested it, or if it was me who put 
the idea in her mind. But as soon as | saw them pull down 
the driveway and out of sight, | got to work. 

“Freddy’s was locked up. They’d taken away Officer 
Dunn’s body and completed their search, under my careful 
guidance, of course. They took some samples, but nothing 
else had been removed from the premises, not yet. They 
were waiting on me to give the go-ahead. The place wasn’t 
even under guard—after all, there was nothing dangerous 
inside, right? So, | waited for things to calm down. Then | 
drove to St. George and rented a U-Haul. 

“It was raining when | picked up the truck, and by the 
time | got to Freddy’s there was a full-on thunderstorm, 
even though the forecast had been clear. | had keys this 
time; all the locks were police-issue now, so | just walked 
right into the place. | knew where | would find them—or at 
least, | knew where I'd left them and prayed they were still 
here. They were all piled together in that room with the little 
stage.” 

“Pirate’s Cove,” Jessica said, her voice barely a whisper. 

“| half expected them to be gone, but they were sitting 
patiently, like they’d been waiting for me. They’re immense, 
you know. Hundreds of pounds of metal and whatever else 
was in there, so | had to drag them one by one. | loaded 
them all up eventually. | figured | would bring them down 
through the storm cellar, but when | got back home the 


lights were on and Betty’s car was in the driveway. She’d 
come back from her trip early, it seemed.” 

“What did you do?” Jessica asked. She was hunched 
over, her chin in her palms. John shook his head, mildly 
amused. She was enjoying the story. 

“| waited across the street. | watched the lights, staking 
out my own house. When the last light went out, | pulled 
into the driveway and started dragging those things again, 
lowering them down into the cellar one by one. | drove the 
truck back to St. George and came back home, all without 
anyone seeing me. It would have never worked if | hadn’t 
had the cover of thunder and lightning to mask what | was 
doing. When | came in, | was soaking wet and my whole 
body ached. All | wanted was to go upstairs to bed, next to 
my wife ...” He cleared his throat. “But | didn’t dare. | took a 
blanket and | slept in front of the basement door, just in 
case something tried to come out.” 

“Did it?” Jessica asked. Clay shook his head slowly back 
and forth, like it had taken on extra weight. 

“In the morning, they were exactly the way I'd left them. 
Every night after that, | went down there when Betty was 
asleep. | watched them, sometimes | even ... talked to them, 
trying to provoke them somehow. | wanted to make sure 
they weren’t going to kill us in our sleep. | went back over 
the case files, trying to figure out how we’d missed Afton. 
How had he managed to come back without anyone 
suspecting? 

“Betty could tell something was wrong. A few weeks 
later, she woke up and came looking for me—she found me, 
and them.” Burke closed his eyes. “I don’t remember 
exactly how the conversation went, but the next morning 
she was gone again, and this time she didn’t come back.” 


John shifted on the couch restlessly. “They haven’t 
moved since then?” 

“They’re just sitting there like broken dolls. | don’t even 
think about them anymore.” 

“Clay, Charlie’s in danger,” John said, standing. “We have 
to go see them.” 

Clay nodded. “Well, then let’s go see them.” He stood 
and gestured toward the kitchen. 

The last time John had stood in the Burkes’ kitchen was 
the morning after they’d all escaped from Freddy’s. Clay had 
been making pancakes and kidding around. Betty, Carlton’s 
mother, was sitting next to her son as if she were afraid to 
leave his side. They were all giddy with relief that the ordeal 
was over, but John could tell that each of them, in their own 
particular ways, was struggling with other emotions, too. 
Someone might stop talking in midsentence, forgetting the 
rest, or stare for several moments at the empty air in front 
of them. They were all just barely recovering. But the 
kitchen had been bright. Light sparkled off the counters, and 
the smells of coffee and pancakes were reassuring, a 
connection to reality. 

Now, John was struck hard by the contrast. There was a 
rank smell, and he could see immediately what it was: the 
counters and table were strewn with dirty dishes, all crusted 
with leftover meals. Most had scarcely been eaten. There 
were two more empty bottles in the kitchen sink. 

Clay opened the door to what looked like a closet, but 
turned out to be the basement steps. He flipped a light 
switch, illuminating a dim bulb right above the stairs, and 
motioned them in. Jessica started forward, but John puta 
hand lightly on her arm, stopping her. Clay went first, 


leading their descent, and John followed, guiding Jessica 
behind him. 

The stairs were narrow and a little too steep. Each time 
John stepped down he felt a slight lurch, his body 
unprepared for the distance. Two steps down the air 
changed: it was damp and moldy. 

“Watch out for that one,” Clay said. John looked down to 
see that one of the boards was missing. He stepped over it 
carefully and turned, offering Jessica a hand as she made 
the awkward jump. “One of many things that’s on my to-do 
list,” Clay said offhandedly. 

The basement itself was unfinished. The floor and walls 
were nothing but the unpainted inner surface of the 
foundation. Clay gestured to a dark corner where the boiler 
lurked heavily. Jessica gasped. 

They were all there, lined up in a row against the wall. At 
the end of the line, Bonnie slumped against the boiler. The 
gigantic rabbit’s blue fur was stained and matted, and his 
long ears drooped forward, almost obscuring his wide, 
square face. He still held a red bass guitar in one enormous 
hand, though it was battered and broken. Half of his bright 
red bow tie had torn off, giving his face a lopsided look. 
Beside him sat Freddy Fazbear. His top hat and matching 
black bow tie were undamaged, their material only a little 
scuffed. And though his brown fur was bedraggled, he still 
smiled for an absent audience. His blue eyes were wide and 
his eyebrows raised, like something exciting was about to 
happen. His microphone was missing, and he held his arms 
out stiffly before him, grasping at nothing. Chica leaned 
against Freddy, her head drooping to the side. The weight of 
her yellow body—inexplicably covered in fur, not feathers— 
seemed to rest entirely on him. Her long, orange chicken 


legs were splayed out in front of her, and for the first time 
John noticed the silver talons on her feet, inches long and 
Sharp as knives. The bib she always wore had been torn. It 
had read: LeT’s EAT!!!, but it was faded by time, along with the 
damp and mildew of the basement. 

John squinted at her. Something else was missing. 

“The cupcake,” Jessica said, echoing his thoughts. 

Then he spotted it. “There on the floor,” he said. It was 
sitting alone beside Chica, almost huddled, its evil grin 
maniacal and pathetic. 

Set a little apart from the three was the yellow Freddy, 
the one that had saved all their lives. He looked like Freddy 
Fazbear, and yet he did not. There was something different 
about him besides the color, but if someone had asked John 
what it was, he knew he wouldn’t be able to name it. Jessica 
and John looked at it for a long moment. John felt a sense of 
quiet awe as he studied the yellow bear. / never got to thank 
you, he wanted to say. But he found he was too scared to 
approach it. 

“Where’s—” Jessica started, then cut herself off. She 
pointed to the corner where Foxy was propped against the 
wall, clothed in shadows but still visible. John knew what he 
would see: a robotic skeleton covered with dark red fur, but 
only from the knees up. It had been tattered even when the 
restaurant was open. Foxy had his own stage in Pirate’s 
Cove. As John peered at him now, he thought he could see 
more places where the fur covering was ripped, and the 
metal frame showed through. Foxy’s eye patch was still 
fixed in place above his eye. While one hand drooped at his 
side, the arm with the large, sharpened hook was raised 
above his head, poised for a downward slash. 


“Is this how you left them?” John asked. 

“Yep. Exactly how | left them,” Clay answered, but he 
sounded suspicious of his own words. 

Jessica approached Bonnie cautiously and crouched down 
to make her eyes level with the enormous rabbit. “Are you in 
there?” she whispered. There was no response. Jessica 
reached out slowly to touch his face. John watched, tensing, 
but as Jessica petted the rabbit, not even dust stirred in the 
mildewed basement. Finally she straightened and took a 
step back, then looked helplessly at John. “There’s nothing 


” 


“Shh,” he interrupted. A noise caught his attention. 

“What is it?” 

John bent his head, craning closer to the sound, though 
he couldn’t tell exactly where it was coming from. It was like 
a voice on the wind, words swept away before he could 
catch them, so that he couldn’t be sure it was a voice at all. 
“Is anyone ... here?” he murmured. He looked at Freddy 
Fazbear, but as he tried to focus his attention, the sound 
situated itself. He turned to the yellow Freddy suit. 

“You're here, aren’t you?” he asked the bear. He went to 
the animatronic and crouched in front of it, but he didn’t try 
to touch it. John looked into its shining eyes, searching for 
any of the spark of life he had seen that night, when the 
golden bear entered the room and they all knew as 
irrefutable fact that Michael, their childhood friend, was 
inside. John couldn’t remember precisely how that 
knowledge had come: there was nothing behind the plastic 
eyes, nothing different physically. It was just pure certainty. 
He closed his eyes, trying to call it back. Maybe by recalling 
that essence of Michael, he could conjure him again. But he 


couldn’t catch it, couldn’t sense the presence of his friend 
as he had that night. 

John opened his eyes and looked at all the animatronics 
one by one, remembering them alive and mobile. Once, the 
children stolen by William Afton had watched him back from 
inside. Were they still inside now, dormant? It was horrible 
to think of them moldering down here, staring into the 
darkness. 

Something flickered in the yellow bear’s eye, almost 
imperceptibly, and John drew in a sharp breath. He glanced 
behind, checking for a light that might have glanced off the 
hard plastic surface, but there was no obvious source. Come 
back, he pled silently, hoping to see the spark again. 

“John.” Jessica’s voice pulled him back to reality. “John, 
I’m not sure that this was a good idea.” He turned toward 
her voice, then stood, his legs cramping. How long had he 
been there, staring into the blind eyes of the mascot? 

“| think there’s still someone in there,” he said slowly. 

“Maybe so, but this doesn’t feel right.” She looked down 
from John toward the suits again. 

Their heads had moved; they tilted up unnaturally, facing 
John and Jessica. 

Jessica screamed and John heard himself shout 
something unintelligible, leaping back as if he’d been stung. 
They were all looking directly at him. John took three 
experimental steps to the left, and they appeared to track 
him: their eyes stayed fixed on him, and him alone. 

Clay had grabbed a shovel and was holding it like a 
baseball bat, ready to strike. “I think it’s time to go.” He 
stepped forward. 

“Stop, it’s okay!” John exclaimed. “They know that we 
aren’t enemies. We’re here because we need their help.” 


John opened his palms toward the creatures. 

Clay lowered the shovel, though he kept it in his hand. 
John looked at Jessica, who nodded rapidly. 

John turned back to the mascots. “We’re here because 
we need your help,” he said again. They gazed back at him 
blankly. “Remember me?” he asked awkwardly. They 
continued to stare, as frozen in their new poses as they’d 
been before. “Please listen,” he went on. “Charlie, you 
remember her, right? You must. She’s been taken by ... 
creatures like you, but not like you.” He glanced at Jessica, 
but she was watching anxiously, trusting this to him. 

“They were animatronic suits, buried under Charlie’s 
house. We don’t know why they were there.” He took a deep 
breath. “We don’t think they were built by Henry; we think 
they were built by William Afton.” 

As soon as John said the name, the robots all began to 
shudder, convulsing where they sat. It was as if their 
machinery was being jump-started by a current too powerful 
for their systems to absorb. 

“John!” Jessica cried. Clay stepped forward and grabbed 
John by the shoulder. 

“We have to get out of here,” Jessica said urgently. The 
mascots were seizing wildly, their arms and legs jerking. 
Their heads banged against the back wall with painful 
clanks. John stood rooted to the spot, torn between the 
impulse to run to them, to try and help, and the urge to run 
away. 

“Go, now!” Clay shouted over the noise, pulling John 
backward. They made their way back up the basement 
Stairs, Clay followed behind with the shovel raised 
defensively. John watched the mascots convulsing on the 
ground until they were out of sight. 


“We need your help to find Charlie!” he shouted one last 
time, as Clay slammed the basement door and snapped 
three shiny new deadbolts shut. 

“Come on,” Clay said. They followed him, chased by 
hideous clanking and banging noises, only slightly muffled 
by the floor beneath. He led them back through the living 
room to a small study branching off from it, where he shut 
the door and bolted it. 

“They're coming up,” John said, pacing and watching the 
ground beneath his feet. Metal ground against metal; 
something crashed like it was slammed against the wall. 
The echo reverberated through the floor. 

“Block the door,” Clay ordered, grabbing one side of the 
desk in the corner. John grabbed the other side as Jessica 
cleared a path for them, yanking two chairs and a lamp out 
of the way. They dropped it in front of the door as, beneath 
them, something scraped across the concrete like it was 
being dragged. 

Heavy footsteps shook the foundation of the house. The 
high-pitched whine of malfunctioning electronics filled the 
air, almost too high to hear. Jessica rubbed her ears. “Are 
they coming for us?” 

“No. | mean, | don’t think so,” John said. He looked to 
Clay for reassurance, but Clay’s eyes were on the door. The 
whine intensified and Jessica clapped her hands over her 
ears. The footsteps grew louder. There was a noise like 
cracking wood. 

“At the door,” Clay whispered. There was a loud thud, 
and then another. John, Jessica, and Clay sank down behind 
the desk, as if it would better hide them. Another thud 
resounded, then a sound of splintering wood. The 
earthshaking footsteps came closer. John tried to count 


them, to see if the creatures were all together, but there 
was too much overlap. They layered one over another, 
rattling his teeth and shaking through his chest. It felt like 
the sound alone might break him to pieces. 

Then, quickly, the footsteps faded and were gone. Fora 
long moment no one moved. John gasped to breathe, 
realizing only now that he’d been holding his breath. He 
looked at the others. Jessica’s eyes were closed, and she 
gripped her hands together so tightly that her fingertips had 
gone white. John reached out and touched her shoulder and 
she jumped, her eyes flying open. Clay was already 
standing, tugging at the desk. “Come on, John,” he said. 
“Help me get this out of the way.” 

“Right,” he said unsteadily. Together they shoved it aside 
and hurried out into the hall. The front door stood wide open 
to the night. John rushed out to look. 

The grass outside had been torn up where the mascots 
shuffled through it. The tracks were obvious and easy to 
follow, leading straight into the woods. John broke into a 
run, chasing after them, Clay and Jessica at his heels. When 
they reached the cover of trees they slowed. In the distance, 
John saw a blur of movement for only an instant, and he 
motioned the others to hold back. They would follow, but 
they didn’t dare be seen by whatever was leading the way. 





The world thundered around Charlie, Shaking her 
rhythmically back and forth, strange objects digging harder 
into her each time she was jostled. Charlie opened her eyes, 
and remembered where she was. Or rather, what she was 
inside. The awful image of the malformed Freddy sucking 
her into its mouth like some kind of snake hit her, and she 
closed her eyes again, biting her lips together so that she 
wouldn’t scream. The thuds were footsteps, she realized: 
the animatronics were on the move. 

Her head throbbed with each blow, making it hard to 
think straight. / must have been knocked unconscious when 
it threw me in here, she thought. The torso of the thing was 
connected to the head by a wide neck, which was almost 
level with her own, though its head stretched up another 
foot above her. It was like looking at the inside of a mask: 


the hollow of a protruding snout, the blank spheres that 
were the backs of the eyes. When she carefully tilted her 
head up, she could even see the bolt that attached the 
black top hat. 

Charlie’s legs were cramped and bent at odd angles, 
wedged between pieces of machinery. She must have been 
stuck this way for some time, but she had no way of 
knowing how long. Her arms were constrained, suspended 
away from her body into the arms of the suit. Her whole 
body was covered in small points of pain, bruises and cuts 
from tiny pieces of plastic and metal that deepened each 
time they banged against her. Charlie could feel blood 
trickling down her skin in half a dozen places. She itched to 
wipe it away but had no idea how much she could struggle 
without triggering the springs. Her mind flashed to the first 
murder victim, the lacerations that covered his body almost 
decoratively. She thought of Dave’s screams as he died, and 
the bloated corpse beneath the stage at Pirate’s Cove. That 
can’t be me. | can’t die like that! 

Charlie had told Clay what she knew about the spring- 
lock suits. The animatronic parts were either recoiled, 
making room for a person inside to use it as a costume, or 
fully extended, so the mascot would work as a robot. But 
that was what Charlie knew from Fredbear’s Family Diner— 
this creature was different. She was inside a cavity made for 
a human being, but the suit was moving with complete 
autonomy. Its insides were full of metal architecture and 
wires, all except for the space that Charlie occupied. 

The animatronic lurched unexpectedly to the side, and 
Charlie was smacked against the jagged wall again with 
greater force. She cried out this time, unable to help herself, 
but there was no break in Freddy’s stride. Either the 


creature hadn’t heard, or it didn’t care. She clenched her 
teeth, trying to quell the pounding in her head. 

Where are we going? She craned her neck this way and 
that, looking through the holes in the animatronic’s battered 
suit. There were only a few holes, small and on either side of 
the thing’s torso. All she could make out was the forest: 
trees rushing by in the darkness as they hurried to their 
mysterious destination. Charlie sighed in frustration, tears 
welling up. Where are you? Am | getting closer to you? 
Sammy, is it you? 

She gave up looking for hints outside and stared straight 
ahead at the inside of the suit. Stay calm, Aunt Jen’s voice 
said in her head. Always stay calm. It’s the only way to keep 
your head clear. She stared up into the mask, at the inside- 
out features of the twisted Freddy. 

Suddenly, the blank spheres rolled back and the eyes 
flipped in, staring straight down at her with an impassive, 
plastic gaze. Charlie screamed and jerked back. Something 
behind her snapped, lashing a whiplike piece of metal into 
her side. She froze in terror. No, please no. Nothing else 
triggered, and after a moment she cautiously settled herself 
in place, trying not to meet the shiny blue eyes above her. 
Her side where the piece of metal had hit her shocked with 
pain each time she breathed. She wondered, alarmed, if a 
rib had broken. Before she could be sure, the animatronic 
lurched to the side again, and Charlie fell with it, hitting her 
head so hard that the blow reverberated through her body. 
Her vision darkened, closing to a tunnel, and as she faded 
into unconsciousness again, all she could see were Freddy’s 
watching eyes. 


John’s lungs were beginning to burn, his legs turning 
rubbery as they ran on and on through the forest. They had 
been running for what felt like hours, though he knew it 
couldn’t be. That was just his exhaustion playing tricks on 
his mind. The trail had faded. When they entered the forest, 
the trees had been their guide. They followed ripped, 
ragged bark and broken branches, and even torn roots 
where massive, careless feet had stepped. 

But the signs had grown farther between, then stopped 
entirely. Now John ran on in the direction the creatures 
seemed to have been headed. 

Truthfully, he might have been lost. 

As he darted around trees, trekked up and down small 
hills, and stumbled on uneven ground, John began to lose 
his sense of direction entirely. Ahead of him, Jessica ran 
confidently onward. He followed, but for all he knew they 
could be running in an endless circle. 

Behind him, Clay’s steps were slowing, his breathing 
heavy. Jessica, a few paces ahead, doubled back, jogging in 
place as she waited for them to catch up. 

“Come on, guys, we’re almost there!” she said 
energetically. 

“Almost where?” John asked, struggling to keep his tone 
even. 

“I’m just trying to be encouraging,” she said. “Il was on 
my high school cross-country team for three years.” 

“Well, | was always more of a heavy-lifter, you know,” 
John panted, suddenly defensive. 

“Clay, come on, you can do it!” Jessica called. John 
glanced back. Clay had stopped running and was doubled 
over with his hands on his knees, taking gasping breaths. 


With relief, John slowed to a walk and turned back. Jessica 
let out a frustrated sound and followed him to Clay. 

“Are you all right?” John asked. 

The older man nodded, waving him back. “Fine,” he said. 
“Go ahead, I'll catch up.” 

“There’s nowhere to ‘go ahead’ to,” John said. “We're 
running blind. When's the last time you saw tracks?” 

“A while back,” Clay said, “but they were heading this 
way, and it’s all we have to go on.” 

“But it’s nothing to go on!” John’s voice rose in 
frustration. “There’s no reason to think they went this way!” 

“We're losing them,” Jessica said urgently. She was still 
running in place, her ponytail bouncing like a little nervous 
animal behind her. Clay shook his head. 

“No, we’ve already lost them.” 

Jessica stopped running, but she kept shifting from one 
foot to the other. “So now what?” 

Something rustled in the trees ahead of them. Jessica 
grabbed John’s arm, then released it quickly, looking 
embarrassed. The sound came again, and John started 
toward it, raising a hand to signal the others to stay. He 
made his way cautiously through the trees, glancing back 
once and noting that Jessica and Clay were close behind, 
despite his attempt to keep them back. 

A few feet farther on, the trees broke into an open field; 
they had reached the far side of the woods. Jessica gasped, 
and a split second later John saw it. Halfway across the 
clearing a figure stood in the darkness. It was almost 
featureless and flat, scarcely distinct from the shadows. John 
squinted, trying to get hold of the image, to assure himself 
he was really seeing it. Heavy, black electrical wires 
stretched above the field like a canopy, but besides the 


wires, the field was clear. Though it was dark, there was no 
way for them to sneak closer to the figure without being 
seen. 

So John straightened his shoulders and began to walk 
Slowly and openly toward it. 

The field was untended, and tall grass brushed John’s 
knees as he walked. Behind him, Jessica and Clay made 
rustling sounds with every step. The wind whipped the grass 
against their legs, blowing more ferociously with each step 
they took. Almost halfway across the field, John stopped, 
puzzled. The figure was still there, but it seemed as far 
away from them as when they’d started. He glanced back at 
Jessica. 

“Is it moving?” she whispered. He nodded and started 
walking again, not taking his eyes from the shadowy figure. 
“John, it looks like ... Freddy?” 

“| don’t know what it is,” John answered cautiously. “But | 
think it wants us to follow.” 


* OK OX 


| can’t breathe. Charlie coughed and gagged, coming 
suddenly awake. She lay on her back, dirt pouring down 
onto her. It filled her mouth, clogging her nose and covering 
her eyes. She spat, shaking her head and blinking rapidly. 
She tried to raise her hands but couldn’t move them. She 
remembered suddenly that they were trapped inside the 
arms of the suit and would be mutilated if she struggled to 
free them. 

Buried alive! I’m being buried alive. She opened her 
mouth to scream and more dirt fell in, hitting the back of 
her throat and making her gag again. Charlie could feel her 


pulse in her throat, choking her from the inside as surely as 
the dirt from outside. Her heart was beating too fast and she 
felt lightheaded. She took faster breaths, trying in vain to fill 
her lungs, but she only stirred up the dirt and inhaled it. She 
spat, gargling at the back of her throat to catch it before she 
swallowed, and turned her head to the side, away from the 
soil that fell like rain. She took a shuddering breath that 
shook her chest, and then another. You’re hyperventilating, 
She told herself sternly. You have to stop. You have to calm 
down. You need your head clear. The last thought came in 
Aunt Jen’s voice. She stared at the now-familiar side of the 
suit and took deep breaths, ignoring the dirt settling in her 
ear and sliding down her neck, until her fluttering heart 
slowed, and she could breathe almost normally again. 

Charlie closed her eyes. You have to get your arms free. 
She concentrated all her attention on her left arm. Her T- 
Shirt left the skin of her arms bare against the suit, so she 
could feel everything that touched her. With her eyes still 
closed, Charlie began to draw a map. There’s something at 
the shoulder joints on either side, and a space just below. 
Spikes in a line all the way down to my elbow on the 
outside, and the inside has—what is that? She rocked her 
arm slowly, gently, back and forth against the objects, 
trying to envision them. They’re not spring locks. She froze, 
focusing again on the place where the arm joined the torso. 
THOSE are spring locks. Okay, I'll get to it. Hands. She 
flexed her fingers slightly: the sleeves were wide, and her 
hands—which reached roughly to the creature’s elbows— 
were less constrained than anything else. She spat out dirt 
again, trying not to notice that it was still pouring in 
steadily, piling up all around her. Breathe. While you still 
can. She clenched her jaw, envisioning the sleeve that 


encased her arm, and slowly began to work her way out of 
it. She dipped down her shoulder, rotated forward, held her 
breath—and pulled her arm three inches out. Charlie let out 
a shuddering sigh. Her shoulder was free of the spring locks. 
That was the hardest part. The rest of my arm won’t touch 
them if I’m careful. She kept going, avoiding the things she 
thought might snap or stab her. When she was halfway out, 
her elbow at the shoulder seam, she twisted her arm too 
quickly and heard a snap. She stared horrified at the suit’s 
Shoulder, but it wasn’t the spring lock. Something smaller 
inside had triggered, and now she could feel the burn of a 
fresh cut. Okay. It’s okay. She got back to work. 

Minutes later, her arm was free. She flexed it back and 
forth in the small space, feeling a little like she had never 
had an arm before. Now the other one. She wiped her face 
with her hand, smearing away the dirt, closed her eyes, and 
began again with her right arm. 

The second sleeve took less time to get out of, but 
fatigue and the growing mounds of dirt around her made 
Charlie careless. Twice she triggered small mechanisms that 
bruised her painfully, but didn’t break her skin. She yanked 
herself free too fast, bumping the spring locks and only 
barely snatching her hand away before they cracked open. 
The arm jumped and jolted as the robotic skeleton inside it 
unfolded with a noise like firecrackers. Charlie clutched her 
hand to her chest, cradling it against her pounding heart as 
she watched. That could have been... It wasn’t. It wasn’t 
me. Focus. Legs. 

Her legs weren’t pinned in place as her arms had been. 
They’d simply been awkwardly positioned, wedged between 
metal rods that ran through the body of the mascot. Without 
the weight of her body resting on them, she was able to 


maneuver. Cautiously, Charlie lifted her right leg into the air, 
pulling it over the rod and into the center of the torso. 
Nothing triggered, and she did the same with her left. 

Her limbs freed, Charlie looked down the length of the 
animatronic, at the door to the chest cavity. The latch was 
on the outside, but these creatures were old; their parts 
were rusted and weak. She reached out and put her hands 
against the metal, feeling for springs and other devices. She 
couldn’t quite see from where her head was stuck, and she 
couldn’t move down safely. Unless. 

The dirt had piled up almost a foot on either side of her 
head, and it covered the lower half of her body. Charlie 
abandoned the door momentarily, and began to slowly 
move the dirt. She lifted her head slightly and brushed at 
the mound with her hands, pushing soil into the space she 
left. She rocked her body back and forth, using her hands to 
sweep dirt under her, until she lay on it like a thin bed. It 
wouldn’t protect her from the suit if she triggered it, but it 
would give her an extra cushion, make it slightly harder for 
her to jostle something and be skewered alive. She glanced 
at the arm of the suit that had been triggered, now filled 
with metal spines and hard plastic parts. A shiver went 
down her back. 

Now she inched down until she could see the chest 
plates, placed her hands in the center, and began to push 
upward with all her might. After a moment they came apart 
and a rush of dirt cascaded in. Charlie coughed and turned 
her head, but she kept pushing as the dirt rained down on 
her. She managed to get the plates a foot apart, then 
crouched beneath them and paused for a moment. How 
deep am |? she thought for the first time. If she’d been 
buried six feet down, she might be escaping only to 


suffocate in the home stretch. What else am | going to do? 
Charlie closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and held it. 
Then she pressed herself up to the doors and began to claw 
her way out of the grave. 

The dirt wasn’t packed tightly, but it still took effort: she 
scratched and scraped at it with her bare hands, wishing for 
a tool as her fingernails split and bled. As she hacked at the 
dirt, her lungs began to burn and clench, trying to get her to 
breathe. She scrunched her face up as hard as she could 
and scratched harder. Are you out there? I’m coming, but 
help me, please, | have to get out of this. Please, | can’t die 
here, buried ali— 

Her hand broke the surface, and she drew it back in 
shock. A/r. She gasped gratefully until she no longer felt 
starved of oxygen. Then she closed her eyes and battered 
her fists at the tiny hole above her head, breaking the sides 
until it was large enough to wriggle through. Charlie stood 
up, her feet still planted in the chest cavity of the suit. There 
had been little more than a foot of dirt covering her. She 
braced her feet on the half-open doors and clambered out of 
the hole, hauling herself up. She collapsed beside it, shaking 
with exhaustion. You’re not safe yet, she scolded herself. You 
have to get up. But she couldn’t bring herself to move. She 
stared, horrified, at the hole she had escaped from, her face 
wet with tears. 

Time passed, minutes or hours; she lost track completely. 
Finally mustering her strength, Charlie pushed herself up to 
a sitting position, wiping her face. She couldn’t tell where 
she was, but the air was cool and still. She was indoors, and 
somewhere in the distance was the sound of rushing water. 
With the adrenaline gone, her head ached again, throbbing 
along with her heartbeat. It wasn’t just her head— 


everything hurt. She was covered in bruises, her clothing 
was Stained with blood, and now that she wasn’t 
suffocating, she was aware again of the stabbing sensation 
in her rib cage every time she inhaled. Charlie prodded her 
ribs, trying to feel if anything seemed out of place. The 
bruises were already brightly colored, especially where parts 
of the suit had struck her, but nothing was broken. 

Charlie stood up, the pain receding enough to at least 
move and get her bearings. As she looked around, her blood 
went cold. 

It was Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. 

It can’t be. The wave of panic rose again. She glanced 
around wildly, backing up, away from the hole in the 
ground. The tables, the carousel in the corner, the stage— 
the tablecloths are blue. “The tablecloths at Freddy’s 
weren't blue,” she said, but her relief was quickly washed 
away by confusion. Then what is this place? 

The dining room was larger than the one at Freddy’s, 
though there were fewer tables. The floor was black and 
white tile, except for large patches where the tiles were 
missing, revealing plots of packed dirt. It was oddly 
incongruous with everything else, which looked finished and 
brand-new, if dusty. As she turned to the opposite wall, she 
saw that she was being watched. Large plastic eyes stared 
back from the dark, glaring down at Charlie, seeming to 
identify her as an intruder. Fur and beaks and eyes stood 
poised like a small army halfway up the wall. 

For a long moment she stood stock-still, bracing herself. 
But the animatronics didn’t move. Charlie took a small step 
to one side, then the other; the eyes did not track her. The 
creatures looked forward, unseeing, at their fixed points. 
Some of their faces were animals, and some seemed to be 


painted like clowns. Others appeared disturbingly human. 
Charlie moved closer and saw what it was they were 
perched on. All along the wall, arcade games and carnival 
attractions were lined up, each with its guardian beast ora 
giant face mounted on top. Their mouths were wide open, 
as if they were all laughing and cheering some invisible 
spectacle. As Charlie peered through the darkness, she saw 
that the animals were unnaturally posed, their bodies 
twisted in ways no animal should be able to twist. She 
scanned the wide-mouthed faces again and shivered. With 
their bodies so torturously bent, they looked like they were 
screaming in pain. 

Charlie took deep breaths. As she calmed herself she 
realized that there was music playing through the speakers 
overhead. It was quiet; familiar, but she couldn’t name it. 

She approached the nearest of the games. A massive, 
contorted birdlike creature with a wide, curved beak 
presided over a large cabinet with a fake pond. Rows of 
ducks sat still in paper water, waiting for rubber balls to 
knock them down. Charlie looked up again at the creature 
perched on top of the game. Its wings stretched wide, and 
its head was thrown upward in the midst of an elaborate 
dance. It cast a shadow in front of the game, right where the 
player would stand. Charlie turned, not stepping any closer. 
Besides the duck pond, there were three arcade consoles 
lined up next to one another, their screens dusty. Three 
large chimpanzees squatted atop them, the tips of their toes 
gripping the edges above the screen. Their arms were 
raised, frozen in motion, and their teeth were bared in mirth, 
rage, or fear. Charlie stared for a moment at the teeth; they 
were long and yellow. 


Something about the arcade games nagged at her. She 
looked them up and down carefully, but nothing tripped her 
memory. None were turned on, and none of them were 
games she had ever seen before. She wiped the dust from 
the screen of the central console, revealing a glossy black 
screen. Her face, distorted in the curved glass, showed only 
a little bruising and a few visible cuts. Charlie self- 
consciously smoothed her hair. 

Wait. At Freddy’s Pizza, ghostly images had been burned 
into the arcade screens after years of play. She pressed a 
couple of buttons experimentally. They were stiff and shiny 
—untouched. 

“That’s why it feels so empty,” she said to the chimp 
above her. “No one’s ever been here, have they?” The great 
ape didn’t respond. Charlie glanced around. There was a 
doorway to her left, the bluish glow of an unseen black light 
emanating from the room beyond. Charlie went toward the 
light, through the door, and into another room of games and 
attractions. Here, too, they were all guarded by mascots, 
some more identifiable than others. Charlie staggered for a 
moment and put her hand on her forehead. “Strange,” she 
whispered, regaining her balance. She looked back the way 
she’d come. /t must be the light making me dizzy, she 
thought. 

“Hello?” someone called faintly in the distance. Charlie 
whirled around as if someone had shouted in her ear. She 
held her breath, waiting for it to come again. The voice had 
been high and scared, a child. The sudden impression of life 
in this place shook her, as if waking her from a dream. 

“Hello!” she called back. “Hello, are you all right? | won’t 
hurt you.” She glanced around the room. The sound of 
rushing water was louder here, making it hard to judge how 


far away the voice had come from. She moved quickly 
through the room, ignoring the wide-eyed creatures and the 
strange and garish games. A simple, skirted table in the 
corner caught her attention, and she went to it swiftly. 
Charlie crouched down, careful to keep her balance, and 
lifted the cloth. Eyes stared back at her and she startled, 
then steadied herself. 

“It’s okay,” she whispered, flipping the cloth up over the 
table. The glimmer of the eyes faded with the rush of light. 
There was no one there after all. 

Charlie put her hands on her forehead and pressed hard 
for a moment, trying to ward off the growing pain in her 
temples. 

She went through another door, now unsure which way 
she’d come from, and discovered the source of the running 
water. Springing from the center of the wall to her left was a 
waterfall. It cascaded down over a rock face protruding 
several feet out, and joined with a riverbed below. The water 
rushed from a wide pipe only partly concealed by the rock. 
The stream below was maybe three feet wide. It crossed the 
room, splitting the floor in two, and disappeared into the 
open mouth of a cave. 

Charlie watched it fora moment, mesmerized by the 
water. After a moment, she noticed a narrow gap in the rock 
face behind the waterfall, just big enough for a person to 
walk through. “Hello?” Charlie called again, but only 
halfheartedly; here the white noise of the water was louder 
than anywhere else. She realized after a second that it was 
a recording, overpowering the sound of the actual water. 

She surveyed the rest of the room: except for the 
waterfall and the little river it was empty, but she noticed 
the floor had a gray border. No, it’s a path. It was narrower 


than a sidewalk, paved with square gray cobblestones. It 
ran alongside the curved wall, tracing the way to the 
waterfall, and led through a narrow passage under the fall 
itself. Charlie crouched down to touch the stones: they felt 
like hard plastic given a rough finish. The path was likely 
there for a time when the place would be filled with other 
attractions; she could probably just walk straight across the 
room. Probably. 

Charlie stepped onto the cobblestones carefully, 
expecting them to give way under her weight, but they held. 
The manufactured coarseness of the rocks’ surface was 
Sharp—it hurt a little to walk on it. Charlie dutifully followed 
the walkway, keeping close to the wall. She had a vague 
sense that stepping off onto the open floor might be 
dangerous. 

When she reached the waterfall, she went to the gap and 
gingerly touched the rock surface. It was the same plastic as 
the cobblestones. Like the path, the cliff was hard plastic, 
solid, but because it looked like rocks it felt insubstantial 
when she touched it. Charlie took her hands away and 
wiped them on her jeans. She stepped carefully sideways, 
scooting through the hole behind the waterfall. The cavern 
was only a few feet long, but she stopped for a moment at 
the center. She felt trapped in the darkness, though she 
could see light on either side. Trapped. Her chest tightened, 
and she screwed her eyes shut. Ca/m down. Focus on what’s 
around you, she thought. Charlie took a long, steadying 
breath and listened. 

Standing beneath the waterfall, the tape recording was 
muffled. She thought she could hear the water itself, 
rushing over her head and spilling down in front of her, 
though she couldn’t see it. There was something else as 


well, quiet but distinct. From above her, or maybe behind, 
Charlie could hear the cranking of gears. A machine was 
churning the water, keeping it flowing in a giant cycle, 
making the whole thing work. The sound of the machine at 
work calmed her; the rising panic subsided, and she opened 
her eyes. 

She took another sideways step, moving closer to the 
light, and stubbed her toe on something hard. A shock of 
pain jolted her. The object tipped over, making a sloshing 
sound as it fell. Grinding her teeth, she waited a moment for 
her toe to stop hurting, then maneuvered herself into a 
crouch. It was a fuel can. For the waterfall, she realized as 
the machinery ground on overhead. There were several 
more, all neatly arranged along the wall, but this one had 
been in the middle of the path. If she had been going faster, 
she would have fallen over it. Charlie set it firmly beside the 
others, and stepped quickly into the other half of the room. 

“Hello?” The voice again, this time a little louder. Charlie 
stood up straight, immediately on alert. It had come from 
ahead. She didn’t respond this time but moved carefully 
toward it, staying on the path and keeping close to the wall. 

The hallway opened out into another room. The lights 
were dimmer here. In the corner opposite Charlie was a 
Small carousel, but there seemed to be little else. Charlie 
scanned the room, and then her breath caught. The child 
was there, motionless, almost hidden in the shadows in the 
far corner of the room. 

Charlie approached slowly, apprehensive of what she 
might find. She blinked and shook her head hard, her 
dizziness resurging. The room seemed to spin around her. 
Who are you? Are you all right? she wanted to ask but kept 
silent. She stepped closer, and the figure came into focus. It 


was just another animatronic, or perhaps just a normal doll, 
made to look like a little boy selling balloons. 

He was perhaps four feet tall, with a round head and a 
round body, his arms almost as long as his stout legs. He 
wore a red-and-blue striped shirt, and a matching propeller 
beanie on his head. He was made of plastic, but his shiny 
face had something old-fashioned about it. Its features 
mimicked fairy-tale dolls carved from wood. His nose was a 
triangle and his cheeks were made rosy with two raised 
circles of dusky pink. His blue eyes were enormous, wide, 
and staring, and his mouth was open in a grin that bared all 
his even white teeth. His hands were fingerless balls, each 
gripping an object. In one he held a red and yellow balloon 
nearly half his size on a stick. In the other he raised a 
wooden sign reading BALLOONS! 

He was nothing like the creatures Charlie’s father had 
made, nothing even like the animatronics that had 
kidnapped her. They were horrible, but she recognized them 
as twisted copies of her father’s work. This boy was 
something new. She circled around him, tempted to poke 
and prod, but she held back. Don’t chance triggering 
anything. 

“You're not so bad,” Charlie murmured, cautious not to 
take her eyes off him. He just kept grinning, wide-eyed, into 
the darkness. Turning her attention to the rest of the room, 
Charlie looked thoughtfully at the carousel, the only thing 
there besides the boy. She was too far away to make out the 
animals. 

“Hello?” said the voice, right behind her. She spun back 
just in time to see the boy turn toward her with a single, 
swinging step. Charlie screamed and ran back the way she 


came from, but beneath her feet the dirt began to stir. It 
jolted, as if something were bumping upward. She 
scrambled backward as the dirt rose again, and something 
broke through the surface. 

Charlie ran for the carousel, the only cover in the room. 
She ducked behind it, lying down on her stomach so her 
body would be hidden behind its base. She stared down at 
the ground and listened to muffled scratches and beating 
sounds as some creature climbed free of its grave. The 
spinning sensation took hold of her again. The black-and- 
white tiles swam beneath her. She tried to push herself up 
to peek over the carousel, but her head felt leaden. The 
weight of it held her down, threatening to pin her back to 
the ground. There’s something wrong with this room. Charlie 
gritted her teeth and yanked her head up; she scrambled to 
her feet, steadying herself against the carousel, and ran 
back the way she came, not looking back. 

The room with the games and the harsh black light was 
dizzying as well, and it sprawled out in all directions. 
Everything seemed farther apart than before, the walls 
miles away. Her mind was numb. She fumbled to remember 
where she was, unable to tell which way was which. She 
stumbled forward, and another mound of earth rose ahead 
of her. Something glimmered. Her eyes lit on the silhouettes 
of arcade machines, their reflective surfaces acting as 
beacons in the dark. 

She staggered toward them, her head swaying, so heavy 
she could hardly stay upright. The walls were crawling with 
activity. Small things skittered disjointedly all over the 
ceiling, but she couldn’t see what they were—they were 
wriggling under the paint. The surface undulated chaotically. 
There was a Strange ringing in the air, and though she only 


now registered it, she realized it had been sounding all 
along. She stopped in her tracks and looked desperately for 
the source, but her vision was clouding and her thoughts 
were slow. She could barely name the things she saw. 
Rectangle, she thought fuzzily. Circle. No. Sphere. She 
looked from one indistinct shape to another, trying to 
remember what they were called. The effort distracted her 
from staying on her feet, and she fell to the ground again 
with a hard thud. Charlie was sitting upright, but her head 
dragged at her, threatening to pull her over. 

Hello? A voice called again. She put her hands on her 
head, forcing it back, and looked up to see several children 
standing around her, all with plump little bodies and broad 
smiling faces. Sammy? She moved toward them 
instinctively. They were blurred, and she couldn’t see their 
features. She blinked, but her vision didn’t clear. Don’t trust 
your senses. Something Is wrong. 

“Stay back!” Charlie screamed at them. She forced 
herself unsteadily to her feet and stumbled toward the 
Shadows cast by the arcade towers. There, at least, she 
might be hidden from whatever worse things lurked in the 
room. 

The children went with her, rushing in trails of color 
around her and sweeping in and out of view. They seemed 
more to float than walk. Charlie kept her eyes on the towers; 
the children were distracting, but she knew there was 
something worse nearby. She could hear the sickening grind 
of metal, and plastic twisting, and a rasping noise she 
recognized. Sharp feet scraped against the floor, digging 
grooves into the tile. 

She crouched low, fixing her eyes on the nearest open 
door, and was struck with a certainty that this was the way 


she had come. She crawled desperately toward it, moving 
as fast as she could without fully standing. Finally, she 
collapsed under her own weight and lay flat on the tile 
again. You have to get up, now! Charlie let out a scream and 
clambered to her feet. She ran headlong into the next room, 
barely keeping her balance, and skidded to a stop. The room 
was full of dining tables and carnival games; it was where 
she’d started, but something had changed. 

All the eyes were tracking her. The creatures were 
moving, their skin stretching organically, their mouths 
Snapping. Charlie ran for the dining table in the center of 
the room, the largest one with a tablecloth that almost 
reached the floor on all sides. She slid to the ground and 
crawled under it, curling herself into a ball and pulling her 
legs tight against her. Fora moment, there was only silence, 
and then the voices began again. He//o? a voice called from 
somewhere nearby. The tablecloth rustled. 

Charlie held her breath. She looked at the thin gap 
between the tablecloth and the floor, but she could see only 
a Sliver of the black-and-white tile. Something shot by, too 
fast to see, and she gasped and drew back, forgetting to be 
silent. The cloth rustled again, swinging gently inward. 
Someone outside was prodding it. Charlie maneuvered 
herself onto her hands and knees, feeling as if she had too 
many arms and legs. The cloth moved again, and this time a 
swirl of color appeared and vanished in the gap. The 
children. They had found her. The tablecloth swung again, 
but now it was moving on all sides, jouncing up and down as 
the children brushed against it. The strange, colorful trails of 
movement appeared and vanished all around the edges of 
her hiding place, surrounding her like a wall of living paper 
dolls. 


Hello? Hello? Hello? More than one spoke at a time now, 
but not in a chorus. Their voices overlapped until the word 
became a meaningless layer of sound, blurred like the 
floating children themselves. 

She turned her face to the side. One of the children 
stared back—it was under the cloth and gazing at her with a 
fixed grin and motionless eyes. Charlie jumped up, banging 
her head on the tabletop. She looked around wildly. She was 
Surrounded: a smiling, blurry face was staring at her from 
every side. One, two, three, four, four, four. She turned in an 
awkward circle on her hands and knees. Two of the children 
feinted at her, making little jumps as if they were about to 
spring. She turned again, and the next one leaped at her, 
Swimming under the cloth in a bright streak of blue and 
yellow. Charlie froze. What do | do? She scrabbled at her 
sluggish brain, trying desperately to revive it. Another 
sweep of color whooshed at her, all purple, and her brain 
awoke: RUN. 

Charlie scrambled to the tablecloth on her hands and 
knees and grabbed it, yanking it off the table as she stood. 
She threw it down behind her and ran, not looking back as 
someone called again, Hello? 

She raced toward a sign propped up in the middle of the 
room, knocking it over behind her as she ran past. Then a 
Shadow near the stage caught her attention, and she 
swerved. She tripped over a chair and just barely managed 
to catch herself on another table. Her head was still too 
heavy. It jerked her forward, and she shoved the table aside, 
managing to stay upright. She arrived at the stage, and in 
the shadow there was a door. 

Charlie fumbled with the knob, but it was spongy, too 
soft to turn. She grabbed it with both hands, putting the 


whole force of her body behind it, and it moved at last: the 
door opened. She hurried through and slammed it shut 
behind her, feeling for some kind of latch. She found one 
and snapped it shut, and as she did her hand brushed a 
light switch. 

A bulb flickered for a moment, then came on dimly, a 
single glowing strand of orange illuminating the room. 
Charlie stared at it for a minute, waiting for the rest of the 
light. No more appeared. 

She leaned back against a cabinet beside the door and 
slid down to sit, putting her hands on her temples and trying 
to shove her head back to a normal size. The relative 
darkness steadied her. She stared down at the floor, hoping 
whatever was happening to her was almost over. She looked 
up, and the room shifted nauseatingly. /t’s not over. Charlie 
closed her eyes, took a deep breath of the stale air, and 
opened them again. 

Fur. Claws. Eyes. She clapped a hand over her mouth to 
stop herself from screaming. A jolt of adrenaline cut briefly 
through the fuzziness. The room was full of creatures, but 
she couldn’t make sense of them. The dark fur of a simian 
arm lay on the floor, inches from her feet, but out of it 
spilled coils and bare wire. The rest of the ape was nowhere 
to be seen. 

There was something large and gray right in front of her, 
a torso with arms and webbed, amphibious hands, but there 
was no head. Instead, someone had balanced a large 
cardboard box where the neck would have been. Past the 
torso were standing figures, a phalanx of shadows. As she 
stared at them, they resolved into something 
comprehensible. They were unfinished mascots, as distorted 
as the ones outside. 


A rabbit stood at the back. Its head was brown like a 
jackrabbit and its ears were swept back, but its eyes were 
just empty holes. The rabbit’s body was hunched to the 
side, and its arms were short, held up as if in surrender. Two 
metal frames stood in front of it. One was headless, and the 
other topped with the head of a red-eyed, slavering black 
dog, whose fangs stuck out from its mouth. Charlie kept her 
eyes on it for a moment, but it didn’t move. Beside it— 

Charlie cringed and ducked her head, covering her face 
with her arms. Nothing happened. Cautiously, she lowered 
her hands and looked again. 

It was Freddy—the misshapen Freddy that had been 
buried. Charlie glanced at the door, then back at Freddy. He 
stared straight ahead, his eyes blank and his hat askew. /t 
can’t be him, she told herself. /t’s just another costume. But 
she shrank back, trying to make herself smaller. 

Something delicately stroked the top of her head. Charlie 
screamed and yanked herself away. She turned to see a 
disembodied human arm on the shelf above where she'd 
been sitting. Its hand stuck out at just the right height to 
brush her head. Other arms were stacked beside it and on 
top of it, some covered in fur and others not. Some had 
fingers, some simply ended, cut off at what would have 
been the wrist. The other shelves were stacked with similar 
things: one with pelts of fur, another with piles of detached 
feet. One just had dozens of extension cords tangled up in 
an ugly nest. 

From outside the door Charlie heard the voice again. 
Hello? The doorknob rattled. She squeezed past the 
mutilated arcade games and chopped-off parts, gritting her 
teeth as she crawled over soft things that squelched 
beneath her weight. As she stepped back, her shoulder 


crashed into one of the standing metal frames, the headless 
one. It rocked on its ungrounded feet, threatening to topple. 
She tried to pull away, but the frame followed, swaying for a 
moment as she fought to free her hands. She yanked them 
back and ducked as more metal frames came crashing to 
the ground. 

She squatted down beside one of the large arcade 
cabinets. The plastic casing was cracked so badly the words 
and pictures were entirely obscured. Right beside her, 
inches away, were Freddy’s stocky legs. Charlie huddled 
down, pressing against the game as if she could blend in 
with it. Don’t turn around, she thought, eyeing the 
motionless bear. The dim light seemed to be moving like a 
spotlight. It glinted off the dog’s red eyes, then the 
gleaming tusk, then off something sharp-cornered at the 
back of the rabbit’s hollow socket. 

Just out of her line of sight, something moved. Charlie 
whipped her head around, but there was nothing there. 
From the corner of her eye, she saw the rabbit straighten its 
spine. She turned frantically back toward it but found it 
hunched in its same agonized posture as before. Slowly, 
Charlie looked around her in a half circle, keeping her back 
pressed against the console. 

Hello? The doorknob rattled again. She closed her eyes 
and pressed her fists to her temples. No one’s here, no 
one’s here. Something rustled in front of her, and Charlie’s 
eyes snapped open. Scarcely breathing, she watched as 
Freddy came alive. A sickly twisting sound filled the room, 
and Freddy’s torso began to turn. He//o? Her eyes shifted to 
the door for a split second, and when she looked back again 
Freddy was still. / have to get out of here. 


She took a moment to measure the path, looking first to 
the door, then to Freddy in front of her, mapping a blurry 
route. At last she went, looking down at her hands and 
nothing else as she crawled steadily around the motionless 
legs of the standing animatronics, and past the half-bestial 
games. Don’t look up. Something brushed against her leg as 
she passed it, and she pressed on, her head down. Then 
something grabbed her ankle. 

Charlie screamed and flailed, trying to kick herself free, 
but the iron grip tightened. She looked frantically over her 
Shoulder: Freddy was crouched behind her, the light glinting 
off his face and making him seem to smile. Charlie yanked 
her foot back with all her strength, and Freddy pulled even 
harder, dragging her closer. Charlie grabbed the leg of a 
pinball game and hoisted herself up to her knees. As Freddy 
tried again to drag her back, the game shook and rattled 
like it was about to fall. Clutching at it with all her might, 
Charlie jerked her body up and forward. Freddy’s claws tore 
her skin as she wrenched herself free, and the pinball 
machine collapsed under her weight. 

Freddy lurched forward. That horrible mouth unhinged 
again like an enormous snake. He crouched down, coming 
toward her in a sinuous motion. She scrambled over the 
broken game toward the door. Behind her, something 
rustled and scraped, but she didn’t look back. Her hand on 
the doorknob, Charlie stopped as the room around her 
swayed. The noise behind her grew louder, closer, and she 
turned to see Freddy crawling toward her in a predatory 
crouch. His mouth was widening. Dirt poured out of it ina 
steady stream. 

“Hello? Charlie?” came a voice from outside. But this 
voice was different; it wasn’t the animatronic child. Charlie 


fumbled at the knob, the spinning sensation in her head 
worsening as Freddy came slowly, purposefully closer. The 
room swayed again, and her hand closed on the knob and 
turned it. She shoved the door open and stumbled into the 
light. 

“Charlie!” someone cried, but she didn’t look up. The 
sudden brightness was piercing, and she held up a hand to 
Shield her eyes as she forced the door shut again. The 
ringing hadn’t stopped while she was in the closet, but now 
it was louder. It filled her ears like a skewer, plunging into 
her swollen brain. She fell to her knees, wrapping her arms 
around her head, trying to protect it. “Charlie, are you 
okay?” Something touched her, and she shied away, her 
eyes screwed shut against the light. “Charlie, it’s John,” the 
voice said, cutting through the awful noise, and something 
in her went still. 

“John?” she whispered, her voice raspy. The dust from 
the grave had settled in her throat. 

“Yeah.” She turned her head and peered up through the 
Shield of her arms. Slowly, the blazing light calmed, and she 
Saw a human face. John. 

“Are you real?” she asked, uncertain what kind of answer 
would convince her. He touched her again, a hand on her 
arm, and she didn’t pull away. She blinked, and her vision 
cleared a little. She looked up, feeling as if she were 
opening herself to attack. Her eyes lit on two more people, 
and her halting mind slowly named them. “Jessica ... ? 
Clay?” 

“Yeah,” John said. She put her hand on his and tried to 
focus. She could see Jessica, who was doubled over, her 
hands over her own ears. 


“The noise,” Charlie said. “She hears the noise, too. Do 
you?” It grew louder, drowning out John’s response, and 
Charlie grabbed his hand. Real. This is real. “The children!” 
she cried out suddenly, as a swath of undulating colors rose 
from underneath the tables. They flew, their feet not 
touching the ground, their bodies leaving comet-like trails of 
color behind them. “Do you see?” Charlie whispered to John. 

“Jessica!” he shouted. “Look out!” Jessica straightened, 
dropping her hands, and yelled something indistinct. The 
children converged on her in a swarm, dancing around her, 
darting in close, then back out again, as if it were a game, 
or an ambush. Two rushed on Clay, who stared them down 
until they shriveled and swirled back to join the circle 
around Jessica. 

“The lights!” Jessica cried, her voice rising above the 
painful ringing noise. “Clay, it’s coming from the lights on 
the walls!” She pointed up, where Charlie could just make 
out a long row of decorative colored lights, evenly spaced. 

A gunshot cut through the clamor, and Charlie gripped 
John’s hand tighter. Jessica’s hands were on her ears again. 
The children were still in motion, but it was a nervous, 
shimmering movement. They’d stopped in place. Clay stood 
with his back to them all, his gun pointed at the wall. Charlie 
watched, wide-eyed, as he took aim again, and shot out the 
bulb of the second light fixture. The room dimmed slightly, 
and he moved on to the third, then the next, then the next. 
As one shot rang out after another, Charlie’s head began to 
equalize, like whatever stuff had filled her to the point of 
bursting was slowly being drained. The room darkened, one 
bulb at a time. Bang. She looked up at John, and his face 
was Clear. “It’s really you,” she said, her voice still choked 
with dust. Bang. 


“It’s really me,” he agreed. 

Bang. 

The children’s shimmering slowed, giving glimpses of 
arms and legs and faces. Jessica took her hands from her 
ears. 

Bang. 

Clay shot the last light, and the children stopped 
shimmering. They wavered briefly on the edge of solidity, a 
sickening ripple of lights in a scattered harmony, and then 
they were still. The room was silent. It was still lit by the 
overhead lights, but all the others were dead. Jessica looked 
around her, bafflement and horror taking turns on her face. 
The children were no longer children. They were wind-up 
toys, plastic boys in striped shirts, wearing plastic smiles 
and propeller beanies, and offering balloons. 

“Jessica, come here,” Clay said in a low voice, holding out 
his hand. She stepped toward him, glancing warily at the 
balloon boys as she moved between them. He took her hand 
to help her through, as if he were pulling her out of a chasm. 
Charlie slowly let go of John’s hand and put hers to her 
temples, checking to make sure everything was still there. 
Her head no longer ached; her vision was clear. Whatever 
had come over her was gone. 

“Charlie,” Jessica said. “Are you all right? What’s going on 
in here? | feel ... drugged.” 

“These things aren’t real.” Charlie steadied herself and 
Slowly got to her feet. “I mean, they’re real, but not how 
we’re seeing them. This whole place is an illusion. It’s 
twisted somehow. Those things ...” She gestured toward the 
wall where Clay had shot out the lights. “Those things are 
like the disc we found. They emit some kind of signal that 
distorts how we see.” Charlie shook her head. “We have to 


get out of here,” she said. “There’s something worse here 
than these.” 

She pushed over a balloon boy, and it toppled easily. Its 
head popped off as it hit the ground, and it rolled across the 
floor. He//o? it muttered, much quieter than before. 





John prodded the plastic balloon boy’s head with his toe. It 
rolled a little farther, but did not speak again. 

“Charlie?” Jessica said shakily. “Where are they? The big 
ones.” 

“| don’t know. My head is still spinning.” Charlie glanced 
around quickly, then drew closer to the others as they 
surveyed the room. Everything had changed when Clay 
shattered the fixtures. The realistic beasts and vicious- 
looking creatures were gone, replaced with strange, hairless 
versions of themselves. They no longer had eyes, only 
smooth, raised bumps of blank plastic. 

“They look like corpses,” John said softly. 

“Or some kind of mold,” Clay said thoughtfully. “They 
don’t look finished.” 


“It’s the lights,” Charlie said. “They were creating an 
illusion, like the chip.” 

“What are you talking about?” Jessica said. “What chip?” 

“It’s—it’s some kind of transmitter, embedded in a disc,” 
Charlie said. “It scrambles your brain, cluttering it with 
nonsense so that you see what you expect to see.” 

“Then why don’t they look like that?” Clay pointed to 
posters on the walls depicting a very cheerful Freddy 
Fazbear with rosy cheeks and a warm smile. 

“Or that.” John had found another, depicting Bonnie 
jovially strumming a bright red guitar so shiny it looked like 
it was made from candy. 

Charlie looked thoughtful for a moment. “Because we 
didn’t come here first.” She walked toward the posters. “If 
you were a little kid and you saw the cute commercials, 
then saw these posters and toys and all that stuff, then | 
think that’s exactly what they would have looked like.” 

“Because you already have those images in your head,” 
John said. He tore the Freddy poster off the wall and stared 
at it momentarily before letting it fall to the ground. “But we 
know better. We know they’re monsters.” 

“And we're afraid of them,” Charlie said. 

“And so we’re seeing them for exactly what they are,” 
John concluded. 

Clay went up to the arcade mascots again, his gun still 
drawn. He walked back and forth in front of the displays, 
looking at them from different angles. 

“How did you find me?” Charlie asked suddenly. “You 
showed up like the cavalry—just in time. How did you know | 
was here? How did you know any of this was here?” 

No one answered right away. John and Jessica looked to 
Clay, who was casting his eyes around the room 


purposefully; he looked like he was searching for something 
specific. “We followed ...” He trailed off. 

Charlie looked at each of the three of them in turn. 
“Who?” she demanded. But just as she spoke, the closet 
door burst open, banging against the wall with a ringing 
clatter. The twisted Freddy who had taken Charlie came 
crashing out, his mouth still unhinged and swinging 
unnaturally. He was a nightmarish version of the Freddy 
they’d known as kids, with searing red eyes and the 
musculature of a monster. He turned his elongated head 
from side to side wildly, his jaw bouncing in place. 

“Run!” Clay yelled, waving his arms and trying to usher 
them together toward the door. Charlie was rooted to the 
ground, unable to take her eyes off the maw of the beast. 

“Wait!” Jessica cried suddenly. “Clay, these aren’t 
possessed like the others—they’re not the lost children!” 

“What?” he said, momentarily stopping his frantic 
movement and looking thoroughly confused. 

“Shoot it!” Jessica screamed. Clay clenched his jaw, then 
raised the gun and aimed at Freddy’s gaping mouth. He 
fired once. The shot was only a few feet from Charlie’s ear, 
and it was deafening. Freddy jerked back, the python-like 
jaw contracting, and for a split second his image blurred and 
distorted. The unnaturally stretched mouth began to close, 
but before it could, Clay fired again, three more times in 
quick succession. With each shot the creature seemed to 
glitch: it blurred, sputtering around the edges. Freddy’s 
mouth curled in on itself, not quite closing but shrinking 
inward, as the bear hunched forward around its wounds. 
Clay fired one last time, aiming for Freddy’s head. Finally, 
the animatronic toppled forward, a misshapen heap on the 
ground. 


Freddy’s image flickered like static on a television screen. 
The color faded from his fur, then everything that made him 
Freddy winked out, leaving only a smooth plastic figure in 
his place. It looked like the rest of the animals in the room, a 
blank mannequin stripped of its characteristics. Charlie 
approached the thing that had been Freddy cautiously. The 
ringing in her ears was beginning to fade. She crouched 
down next to the creature, tilting her head to the side. 

“It’s not like the other mascots from Freddy’s,” she said. 
“These aren’t made of fur and fabric, they’re made of us— 
by twisting our minds.” The words came out with a revulsion 
she hadn’t expected. 

“Charlie,” John said softly. He stepped forward, but she 
ignored him. She touched the creature’s smooth skin. It felt 
like something between plastic and human skin: a strange, 
malleable substance that was a little too soft, a little too 
slick. The feeling of it made her nauseous. Charlie leaned 
over the body, ignoring her disgust, and plunged her fingers 
into one of the bullet holes. She dug around in the slippery, 
inorganic stuff of the chest cavity, pretending not to hear 
Jessica and Clay’s protests, and then she found it. Her 
fingers touched the disc, which was bent in half, almost 
broken. Charlie pried out a second piece of metal that was 
wedged beside it. 

She stood up and held it out to the others; a bullet rested 
in her palm. 

“You shot the chip,” she said. “You killed the illusion.” 


* OK OX 


No one spoke. In the momentary quiet, Charlie was 
suddenly aware of the racket they had just made, in this 


place so accustomed to stillness. The silence was broken by 
a clicking sound: the noise of claws on tile. 

They all whirled to see, and from what had appeared to 
be a dark and empty corner, a wolflike figure split away 
from the shadows and stalked toward them, upright but 
hunched forward, as if uncertain whether to walk as a beast 
or a human. 

They backed away as one. Charlie saw Clay about to trip 
on Freddy’s collapsed body. She shouted, “Look out!” He 
stopped, turning to see, and his eyes widened at something 
behind Charlie. 

“There!” he cried, and fired a shot into the dark. They 
turned: an eight-foot, misshapen Bonnie, the rabbit 
counterpart to the creature on the floor, was blocking the 
doorway behind them. Its head was too large for its body, 
with eyes glowing white-hot in the dark. Its mouth was 
open, revealing several rows of gleaming teeth. Clay fired 
again, but the bullet had no effect. 

“How many bullets do you have left?” John said, 
measuring up the two threats still in the room. 

Clay fired off three more shots at Bonnie, then lowered 
the gun. 

“Three,” he said dryly. “I had three.” From the corner of 
her eye, Charlie saw John and Jessica draw closer together, 
moving a little behind Clay. She stayed where she was as 
the others retreated, transfixed by the two advancing 
figures: the wolf and the rabbit. She started to walk toward 
them. 

“Charlie,” John said with a warning tone. “What are you 
doing? Come back!” 

“Why did you bring me here?” Charlie asked, looking 
from one creature to the other. Her chest was tight and her 


eyes ached, like she’d been holding back tears for hours. 
“What do you want from me?” she shouted. They looked 
back at her with implacable plastic eyes. “What is this 
place? What do you know about my brother?” she 
screamed, her throat raw. She flung herself at the wolf, 
hurtling toward the gigantic beast, as if she could tear it 
apart with her bare hands. Someone caught her by the 
waist. Human hands lifted her up and pulled her back, and 
Clay spoke quietly into her ear. 

“Charlie, we need to go, now.” She pulled herself out of 
his grasp, but remained where she was. Her breath was 
unsteady. She wanted to scream until her lungs gave out. 
She wanted to close her eyes and sit very still, and never 
emerge from the darkness. 

Instead she looked again from Bonnie to the nameless 
wolf and asked, her voice so calm it chilled her to hear it, 
“Why do you want me?” 

“They don’t care about you. I’m the one that brought you 
here.” A voice spoke from the same shadowed corner the 
wolf had emerged from. The rabbit and the wolf 
straightened their posture, as if responding to the speaker’s 
command. 

“I know that voice,” Jessica whispered. A figure began to 
limp forward, obscured by darkness. No one moved. Charlie 
realized she was holding her breath, but she didn’t hear 
anyone else breathing in the silence, either, just the uneven 
shuffle of whatever was coming. Whatever it was, it was the 
size of a man. Its body was contorted, sloping to one side as 
it lurched toward the group. 

“You have something that belongs to me,” said the voice, 
and then the figure stepped into the light. 


Charlie gasped and heard John’s sharp intake of breath. 
“Impossible,” Charlie whispered. She felt John move up to 
stand beside her, but she didn’t dare take her eyes off the 
man who stood before them. 

His face was dark, the color mottled, and it was swollen 
with fluid; cheeks that had been hollow were now distended 
with the bloat of decay. His eyes were bloodshot, the burst 
capillaries threading through eyeballs that looked just a little 
too translucent. Something inside them had gone bad, 
jellylike. At the base of his neck, Charlie could see two 
pieces of metal gleaming. They extended from within his 
neck, rectangular lumps standing out from his mottled skin. 
He wore what had once been a mascot suit of yellow fur, 
though what remained was now green with mold. 

“Dave?” Jessica breathed. 

“Don’t call me that,” he snarled. “I haven’t been Dave for 
a long time.” He held out his new hands: blood-soaked and 
forever sealed inside a rotting suit. 

“William Afton, then? Of Afton Robotics?” 

“Wrong again,” he hissed. “I’ve accepted the new life 
that you gave me. You’ve made me one with my creation. 
My name is Springtrap!” The man who had once been Dave 
cried the name with a hoarse glee, then scrunched his 
gnarled face back into a glare. “I’m more than Afton ever 
was, and farmore than Henry.” 

“Well, you smell terrible,” Jessica quipped. 

“Ever since Charlie remade me, set me free to my 
destiny, I’ve been master of all these creatures.” He crooked 
his fingers and made a sharp gesture forward. Bonnie and 
the wolf took two steps forward, in unison. “See? All the 
animatronics are linked together; it was a system designed 
to control the choreography for the shows. Now, | control 


the system. | control the choreography. All of this belongs to 
me.” 

Springtrap shuffled forward, and Charlie shrank back. “1 
owe you both another debt of gratitude as well,” he said. “| 
was imprisoned in that tomb beneath the stage, scarcely 
able to move, only able to see through the eyes of my 
creatures.” 

He gestured at the two who stood behind him. “But for all 
that | could see, | was trapped. Eventually they would have 
broken me out, but having you do it yourself was a 
delightful surprise.” He met Charlie’s eyes, and a muscle 
twitched in her cheek. 

Get away from me, don’t come any closer. As if reading 
her thoughts, he sidled nearer to her. She would have felt 
his breath on her face, if he still breathed. 

Springtrap raised a bent hand. The fabric suit was 
ragged, revealing his human skin through the gaps. She 
could see the places where metal pins and rods had buried 
themselves alongside his bones and tendons, into a rusted 
sShadow-skeleton. He touched the back of his hand to 
Charlie’s face, stroking her cheek like a beloved child. From 
the corner of her eye, she saw John start forward. 

“No, it’s okay,” she forced herself to say. 

“| won’t hurt your friends, but | need something from 
you.” 

“You have to be kidding,” she said, her voice brittle. 

His mouth twisted into something that grotesquely 
resembled a smile. 

John heard a faint click, and turned just in time to see 
Clay loading one bullet quietly into his gun. Clay shrugged. 
“You never know when a corpse may wander out of the 


shadows wearing a rabbit suit.” He raised his arm, steadied 
himself, and fired. 

Springtrap recoiled. “Kids!” Clay shouted, “the door!” 
Charlie jerked her eyes away from Springtrap almost 
painfully, as if he had been exerting some hypnotic force on 
her. Bonnie had abandoned the exit, leaving it clear. Clay, 
John, and Jessica began to run. Charlie glanced back, 
reluctant to go, then joined the others. 

They ran back the way they’d come from, Clay leading 
the way as they wound through the carnival games and 
looming, featureless mascots. He strode purposefully ahead, 
as if he knew the way. Charlie remembered her question 
that no one had answered. How did you find me? 

They were chased by sounds: scraping metal and the 
clack of the wolf’s claws. In the open space, the noises 
echoed strangely, seeming to come from every side. It was 
as if an army pursued them. Charlie quickened her step. She 
glanced up at John, seeking reassurance, but his eyes were 
on Clay ahead of them. 

They reached the room with the waterfall, and again Clay 
knew the path. He headed directly for the passage beneath 
the cliff, where the water emerged. They pressed through it 
one by one. Clay and John were too tall to walk through 
without bending over, and Charlie felt a quick pang of relief. 
The monsters won’t fit. Halfway through the passage, Clay 
paused, standing motionless in an awkward position. He 
craned his neck, studying something just out of view. 
“Clay!” Charlie hissed. 

“| have an idea,” he said. Two shadows emerged from the 
far side of the room. Jessica glanced at the black-lit tunnel 
beside them, ready to run for it. But Clay shook his head. 
Instead, he guided the group backward, none of them taking 


their eyes off the monsters. All that shielded them now was 
the river that bisected the room. The animatronics were 
approaching the water hesitantly. The wolf sniffed at it and 
shook his fur, and Bonnie simply bent down and stared. 
“Don’t run,” Clay said sternly. 

“They can’t cross that thing, right?” Charlie said. 

As if responding to her cue, the two mascots stepped 
unsteadily into the river. Jessica gasped, and Charlie took an 
involuntary step back. Slowly and deliberately, the 
animatronics continued toward them through the waist-high 
water. The wolf slipped on the smooth bottom and fell. It 
dunked completely under the water for a moment, before 
scrambling to the side, thrashing violently. Bonnie lost his 
footing as well but managed to grab the riverbank and 
steady himself, then continued forward. 

“That’s not possible,” Charlie said. Behind her came a 
peal of laughter, and she whirled around. 

It was Springtrap, his eyes scarcely visible, peering 
through the black-lit tunnel nearby. “Was that your plan?” 
he said incredulously. “Did you think my robots would be as 
poorly designed as your father’s?” 

“Well then, I’m sure you made them fireproof as well!” 
Clay called out. His voice reverberated in the cavernous, 
empty room. Springtrap frowned, puzzled, then looked at 
the water in the stream. It was glistening in the dim light, 
color dancing on its surface in gleaming swirls, like— 

“Gasoline.” Charlie turned to face Springtrap. Open gas 
cans lined the walls, some lying on their sides; all were 
empty. 

Clay flicked a lighter and flung it into the water. The top 
of the river caught fire, a flame billowing up like a tidal 
wave, obscuring the animatronics in the middle. The 


creatures struggled to the side of the river, emitting 
guttural, high-pitched shrieks. They managed to crawl onto 
the bank, but it was too late. Their illusions deactivated. 
Their plastic skin was exposed, liquefying and falling from 
their bodies into little flaming pools on the floor. Charlie and 
the others watched as the dissolving creatures fell, writhing 
in agonized screams. 

They all stood frozen, mesmerized by the gruesome 
spectacle. Then, from behind her, Charlie heard a quiet 
scraping sound. She whirled around to see Springtrap 
vanish into the mouth of the narrow, black-lit cave. She took 
off after him, running into the eerie light. 

“Charlie!” Clay called. He began to chase her, but the 
flaming creatures had crawled across the floor—perhaps 
trying to reach their master, perhaps in mindless 
desperation—and now they blocked the mouth of the cave 
with their blazing remains. Charlie set her eyes on the path 
ahead. She couldn’t afford to look back. 

The passage was narrow, and it smelled damp and 
ancient. The floor felt like rock beneath her bare feet, but 
though it was uneven, it wasn’t painful. The surface was 
worn and smooth. As soon as the dark of the cave closed 
over her, she felt a spark from her dreams: the tug of 
something so like her that it was her, blood calling to blood. 

“Sammy?” she whispered. His name glanced off the cave 
walls, shrouding her in the sound of it. The absence inside 
her pulled her forward, drawing her toward the promise of 
completion. /t has to be you. Charlie ran faster, following a 
call that came from deep inside her. 

She could hear the distant echo of Springtrap’s laughter 
at intervals, but she couldn’t spot him ahead of her. 
Occasionally she thought she caught glimpses of him, but 


he was always gone before her eyes had time to focus in the 
disorienting glow of the black light. The cave twisted and 
turned until she had no idea which direction she was 
headed, but she ran on. 

Charlie blinked as something moved at the corner of her 
eye, just out of sight. She shook her head and ran on, but 
then it happened again. An unnatural shape, neon-bright, 
slithered out of the wall and wriggled past her. 

Charlie stopped, clapping a hand over her mouth so she 
wouldn’t scream. The thing undulated up the wall, moving 
like an eel though it was climbing rock. When it reached the 
ceiling, it vanished, but she couldn’t see a break in the rock 
where it might have gone. /ust keep going. She started to 
run again, but suddenly more of them poured out of the 
seam at the base of the wall. Dozens of wriggling shapes 
Swam and danced, moving along the floor of the cave like it 
was the floor of the sea. Three of them headed right for 
Charlie. They rippled over her feet and she screamed, then 
realized as they circled her, nibbling curiously at her toes, 
that she felt nothing. “You aren’t real,” she said. She kicked 
at them, and her foot passed straight through empty air: the 
creatures had vanished. Charlie gritted her teeth and ran 
onward. 

Ahead of her, large glowing creatures like dancers made 
of mist appeared and vanished one after another. They 
dashed across the passage, as if they were running along a 
path that just happened to intersect with this one. When 
Charlie was almost close enough to touch them, the one 
nearest sputtered and faded out. She ran on, listening for 
the sound of Springtrap’s maniacal giggle, hoping that it 
was enough to guide her. 


She turned a corner, then the passage angled sharply the 
other way. Charlie ran straight into the wall, catching herself 
with her hands at the last second. She spun around, looking 
for the way forward. The jolt had been enough to distract 
her. She couldn’t tell which way she had come from. Charlie 
took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She could hear a 
soft voice in the air. Left. She started running again. 

A burst of blue light nearly blinded her as a massive 
Shape rose in the darkness. Charlie screamed, flinging 
herself back against the wall of the cave and throwing her 
arms up to shield her face. The thing before her was a 
gaping mouth full of teeth, all glowing blue. The enormous 
maw bore down over her. 

“It’s an illusion,” Charlie whispered. She ducked and tried 
to roll away in the narrow space. Her shoulder struck a rock 
and her arm went numb. Charlie clutched it instinctively and 
looked up: nothing was there. 

She pressed her back against the wall of the cave, taking 
deep breaths as feeling slowly returned to her arm. “It’s 
another transmitter,” she said quietly. “Nothing | see here is 
real.” Her voice was thin in the rocky passage, but saying 
the words aloud was enough to make her stand again. She 
closed her eyes. The connection she had felt was growing 
stronger as she ran, the sense that she was running toward 
a missing piece of herself. It was unbearable, stronger than 
the urge to fight or flee from danger. It was greater than 
hunger, deeper than thirst, and it pulled at the core of her 
being. She could no more turn back than she could choose 
to stop breathing. She set off again, hurtling farther into the 
cavern. 

Far in the distance, Springtrap’s laughter still echoed.

“Charlie!” John called again, but it was hopeless. She was 
long out of sight, deep into the cave, and what remained of 
Bonnie and the wolf still burned in front of the opening. 

“We have to go!” Clay shouted. “We can find another 
way!” Jessica grabbed John’s arm and he gave in, following 
Clay toward the arcade entrance. 

Just as they reached the door, the twisted Freddy lunged 
out of the shadows, almost falling to the ground. Jessica 
screamed and John froze, struck still at the sight of him. His 
illusion sputtered on and off in pieces. An arm flickered 
away, exposing the smooth plastic underneath. Then the fur 
returned and his torso went blank, revealing the gunshot 
holes, and the ugly, twisted metal beneath the plastic shell. 
Worse was the face: not only was the illusion missing, but 
the material underneath. From his chin to his forehead, the 
left half of Freddy’s face had been ripped away, revealing 
metal plates and gnarled wires. His left eye glowed red amid 
the exposed machinery, while his right eye was completely 
dark. 

A noise behind them broke John from his horrified 
reverie. He looked back to see that Bonnie and the wolf had 
gotten to their feet, still smoldering. Their plastic casings 
had almost entirely melted away, still dribbling slowly off 
their bodies, but the robotic works beneath seemed intact. 
They approached steadily, moving into position, so that 
John, Clay, and Jessica were surrounded. 

“Do you have any bullets left?” John asked Clay in a low 
voice. Clay slowly shook his head. He was turning ina 
cautious circle, shifting his gaze from one animatronic to the 
next, as if trying to gauge which would make the first strike.

Charlie ran steadily on, keeping her eyes on the path. She 
turned another corner and blinked. Something was glowing 
blue ahead of her. /t’s not real, she told herself. She paused 
fora moment, but the glowing shapes didn’t move. She kept 
going, realizing as she drew closer that the passageway was 
widening, opening out finally into a small alcove where the 
blue glow became clear. 

The floor was spotted with patches of mushrooms, their 
caps glowing an intense neon blue under the black light. 
She slowed her pace, went to the nearest grouping and bent 
to touch the mushrooms. She snapped her hand back in 
surprise when she felt a spongy substance. “They’re real, 
sort of,” she said. 

“Yes,” said a voice beside her ear, and then she was 
choking. Springtrap grabbed her by the neck, crushing her 
windpipe. Charlie only panicked for a moment before anger 
returned to her, giving her clarity. She reached her arm out 
forward as far as she could, then jammed it back, striking 
her elbow into his solar plexus with as much force as she 
could muster. His hands dropped from her throat and she 
leaped free, turning to face him as he clutched his injured 
gut. 

“Things have changed since you died,” Charlie said, 
surprised by the calm disdain in her voice. “For one thing, 
I’ve been doing sit-ups!”

“I think this is it,” Jessica said quietly, spinning in place as 
the three monsters approached, leaving no avenue of 


retreat. John felt his chest clench, his body protesting the 
idea. But she was right. He put a hand on her shoulder. 

“Maybe we can play dead,” he said. 

“| don’t think we’ll have to play,” Jessica said resignedly. 

“Backs together,” Clay barked, and they backed up into a 
tiny triangle, each facing one of the creatures. The wolf was 
crouched, ready to spring. John met its eyes. They were 
sputtering in and out: dark and malevolent, then completely 
blank. The thing drew back, and John steeled himself. Jessica 
grabbed his hand, and he clenched hers tightly. The wolf 
leaped—and then fell to the ground screeching as 
something knocked it viciously on its face. The figure, 
invisible in the shadows, grabbed the wolf's feet and yanked 
it backward, dragging it away from its human prey as it 
howled, scrabbling at the floor with its claws. It kicked its 
hind legs, freeing itself, and began its attack again. Jessica 
screamed, and John shouted with her, then watched, 
breathless, as the wolf was caught by its feet again. The 
thing that held it flipped it onto its back and jumped on top 
of it. The new predator paused for an instant, meeting their 
eyes with a silver glow, and Jessica gasped. 

“Foxy,” John breathed. As if sourred on by hearing his 
name, Foxy plunged his hook into the wolf’s chest and 
began to tear at its exposed machinery. The screeches of 
metal ripping apart metal ground at their ears. Foxy 
continued to dig furiously, burrowing into the wolf as wires 
and parts fell from the sky. He snapped his jaws in the air, 
then tore at the wolf’s stomach, wrenching out its insides 
and flinging them aside with a brutal efficiency. The wolf 
was overpowered, its limbs flailing helplessly before falling 
heavily to the ground. 


Behind them came another inhuman scream. John 
whipped around in time to see the fire-ravaged Bonnie on its 
stomach, being dragged steadily into the shadows. Its eyes 
blinked on and off in a panicked, meaningless pattern. It 
screamed again as, with a horrible grinding sound, it was 
torn to pieces by whatever lurked in the shadows. Pieces of 
metal and shredded plastic scattered across the floor, 
Skittering out in front of the prone rabbit, so that it could 
see the remnants of its own lower half. It screamed again, 
anchoring its claws into the tile in a last, futile defense, only 
to be pulled screeching into the dark as though through a 
grinder. In the shadows, four lights glowed. John blinked, 
realizing they were eyes. He nudged Jessica. 

“I can see them,” he whispered. “Chica and Bonnie! Our 
Chica and Bonnie!” Beside the river, Foxy had torn the 
wolf’s limbs from its body. He leaped from the ravaged torso 
and took an attack posture toward the large, twisted Freddy, 
which twitched and flickered for a moment, then lowered its 
massive head and charged. Foxy leaped, hitting the twisted 
Freddy’s face with full force and knocking it onto its back, 
then tearing into its head cavity, slashing at what was left of 
the twisted face with enthusiasm. 

Something grabbed John and he snapped out of his 
trance. The twisted Bonnie grabbed him with an arm of 
exposed metal, but the eyes in the dark rose suddenly 
behind it. The original Bonnie grabbed the torso of the 
twisted Bonnie and threw it aside to where Chica waited; 
she grabbed the misshapen rabbit’s head and wrenched it 
off in a burst of sparks. 

John shielded his eyes. When the smoke settled, all that 
remained was the hollow, burnt corpse of an unidentifiable 
monster. Bonnie and Chica had vanished into the shadows.

Charlie ran for the mouth of the passage, but Springtrap 
leaped on her with preternatural speed. He knocked her to 
the ground and reached again for her neck with his swollen 
hands. Charlie rolled out of the way, and something jabbed 
her hard in the back. She snatched at it, and a mushroom 
Cap came away in her hands. She leaped to her knees as 
Springtrap got to his feet, circling her, looking for an 
opening. She glanced down: a sturdy, metal spike had held 
the mushroom cap in place. She wrapped her hand around 
its base, blocking it from Springtrap’s sight with her body. 

Charlie looked up at him, meeting his gelatinous eyes, 
silently daring him to attack. As if on cue, he sprang at her, 
leaping with his arms thrust out, stretching again toward her 
throat. At the last moment, Charlie ducked her head and 
thrust the spike upward with all her might. It stopped with a 
jolt as it hit his chest, but she drove it in, ignoring his 
sputtering cries as he tried uselessly to beat her away. She 
stood, her hands shaking as she shoved the stake in as far 
as it would go. He toppled backward, and she knelt swiftly 
beside him, giving the metal spike another thrust. 

“Tell me why,” she hissed. It was the question that 
consumed her, the thing that kept coming back in her 
nightmares. Now he said nothing, and she rocked the stake 
back and forth in his chest. He made a gagging cry of pain. 
“Tell me why you took him! Why did you choose him? Why 
did you take Sammy?”

“Into the cave!” John shouted. “We have to get Charlie!” 


They hurried to the opening, but from inside the cave 
came a Strange, overwhelming clatter. They all stepped 
back as a horde of the balloon boys emerged from the cave, 
Shaking back and forth on unsteady feet, their pointed teeth 
chattering loudly as they wobbled forward with staring eyes. 

“Not again! | hate these things!” Jessica cried. Clay took 
up a fighting stance, but John could see they would be 
overwhelmed. There was something different about the 
children now, something coordinated. Though they shook 
and wobbled, it no longer seemed like a sign of weakness. 
Instead, John thought of warriors rattling their shields: the 
threat before the battle. 

“We have to get away,” he said. “Clay!” 

Something shook the earth—pounding, even footsteps— 
as a Shadow loomed above them. John looked up and saw a 
smiling Freddy Fazbear approaching, his hat at a jaunty 
angle and his massive limbs swinging. “Oh no! He’s back!” 
Jessica screeched. 

“No, wait! That’s our Freddy!” John grabbed Jessica and 
Shielded her with his arms. Freddy lumbered past them and 
into the crowd of balloon boys. With a single lunge he 
Smashed both arms into the crowd, creating a deafening 
shatter of metal and plastic. The air was filled with arms, 
legs, and broken shrapnel. Freddy got to his feet and 
grabbed one of the balloon boys, lifting it up like it weighed 
nothing. He crushed its head with one hand. Freddy tossed 
the body to the ground and stomped on it, pursuing the 
others as they ran. They scattered, but Freddy was moving 
swiftly, and the room resounded with the noise of cracking 
plastic. 

“Come on, into the cave!” Clay yelled over the din, and 
they ran for the passage. They hurried down the narrow 


path, Clay at the front and John taking up the rear, glancing 
behind to make sure they weren’t being followed. Suddenly 
Clay halted, and Jessica and John nearly ran into him. 
Crowding up beside him, they saw why he’d stopped: the 
path split, and there was no trace of Charlie. 

“There,” Jessica said suddenly. “There’s a light!” 

John blinked. It was dim, but he saw it. Somewhere down 
the passage there was a blue glow, though it was impossible 
to tell how far away it was. “Come on,” he said grimly, 
pressing past Clay to take the lead.

“Why did you take Sammy?!” Charlie cried again. Springtrap 
wheezed and smiled but did not speak. She grabbed his 
head with both hands, desperate with fury. She lifted his 
head and brought it crashing against the rock where it lay. 
He made another sharp grunt of pain, and she did it again. 
This time something began to ooze from the back of his 
head, running thickly down the rock. “What did you do to 
him?” Charlie demanded. “Why did you take him? Why did 
you choose him?” He looked up at her; one of his pupils had 
swallowed the iris of his eye. He smiled vaguely. 

“Il didn’t choose him.” 

Hands grabbed Charlie’s shoulders, dragging her up and 
away from the semiconscious Springtrap. She shouted and 
turned to fight back, only stopping herself when she saw 
that it was Clay. The others were behind him. She turned 
back, shaking with rage. 

“TIL kill you!” she cried. She lifted Springtrap up by the 
shoulders and shoved him back against the rock. His head 
bounced and lolled to the side. “What do you mean you 


didn’t choose him?” Charlie said, leaning in close to him, as 
if she might read the answers in his battered face. “You took 
him from me! Why did you take him?” 

Springtrap’s mismatched eyes seemed to focus for a 
moment, and even he seemed to have difficulty muttering 
his next words. 

“| didn’t take him. | took you.” 

Charlie stared, her fingers going lax, loosening on 
Springtrap’s moldy suit. What? The rage that had filled her 
to the breaking point drained away all at once. She felt like 
she’d lost too much blood and was going into shock. 
Springtrap didn’t try to get away; he just lay there coughing 
and sputtering, his eyes once more unfocused, staring into a 
void Charlie couldn’t see. 

Suddenly the floor rattled beneath them. The walls 
rocked inward as the whole cave shook, and something 
mechanical roared on the other side of the wall. The sounds 
of grinding metal filled the air. 

“It’s a battle royale out there!” Clay shouted. “This whole 
place is coming down!” Charlie glanced at him, and as soon 
as her head was turned she felt Springtrap slip from her 
fingers. She whipped back around, just in time to see him 
roll through an open trap door at the base of an enormous 
rock a few feet away. Charlie leaped up to follow him, but 
the floor quaked violently. She lost her footing, nearly falling 
as half the cave wall came tumbling down. She stopped, 
glancing around in confusion: real rock and dirt cascaded all 
around them. “It’s not the fake cave that’s collapsing!” she 
shouted to the rest. “It’s the whole building!” 

“Is everyone okay?” Clay shouted. Charlie nodded, and 
saw that John and Jessica were still on their feet. “We have 
to go!” Light shone through a crack in the wall ahead. Clay 


started for it, motioning the others to follow. Charlie 
hesitated, unable to take her eyes from the last place she’d 
seen Springtrap. John put a hand on her arm. 

The walls of the fake cavern had almost completely 
fallen, and now they could see the actual interior of the 
complex. 

“That way!” Clay shouted, pointing to a narrow 
maintenance hall that seemed to stretch off endlessly into 
the distance. “None of these things will be able to fit 
through there!” Clay and Jessica ran for the entrance to the 
corridor, but Charlie faltered. 

“Charlie, we can deal with him another day,” John 
shouted over the din. “But we need to survive this one 
first!” The ground shook again and John looked at Charlie. 
She nodded, and they ran. 

Clay led them racing through the tunnel as the sound of 
its collapse chased them. The air was filled with dust, 
obscuring the path ahead. Charlie looked back once, but the 
ruins were lost in the haze. Eventually the rumble of falling 
rock was reduced to a distant thunder. The clean, narrow 
hallway began to feel removed from the madness behind 
them. 

“Clay we have to stop,” Jessica cried, holding her side 
like she was In pain. 

“I see something up ahead. | think we’re almost to the 
end of this. There!” The hallway ended in a heavy metal 
door, partially cracked, and Clay beckoned John to help him 
open it. It squealed and protested, then gave way at last, 
Opening into a simple room of dark stone. One wall of it had 
been knocked down, and the room gaped open, the cool 
night air pouring in. 


John looked at Charlie. “We’re out! We’re okay!” He 
laughed. 

“Don’t you see where we are?” she whispered. Slowly, 
she walked the length of the room, gesturing to the four 
enormous pits in the floor, one of which contained a 
headless, half-buried robot. “John, this is my dad’s house. 
It’s the room we found.” 

“Come on, Jessica.” Clay was helping Jessica through the 
gap in the collapsed wall. He paused and looked back to 
John. 

“It’s okay,” John said. “We'll be right there.” Clay nodded. 
He helped Jessica through and moved out of sight. 

“What is this?” Charlie put her hand on her stomach, a 
sudden unease settling over her. 

“What's wrong?” John asked. Something flickered all 
around them, a disorienting flash, too fast to even tell where 
it had come from. A thunderous crash echoed from the hall 
they’d just broken out of. “Charlie, | think we should go with 
Clay.” 

“Yeah, I’m coming.” Charlie followed John to the gap in 
the wall as he climbed through it. 

“Okay, come on,” John shouted, holding out his hand to 
her from what had once been her own backyard. She started 
forward, then stopped as the lights flickered again. What Is 
that? 

It was the walls. The whitewashed concrete was blinking 
in and out of existence, shivering like a dying bulb. It was 
the wall Charlie had been drawn to the first time they came 
to this place. Now she felt its pull as she had in the cave. It 
was stronger here than it had ever been, even in the 
dreams that left her drained and aching. /’m here. She took 


a step toward the far wall and felt another pang in her 
stomach. Here. Yes, here. 

“Charlie!” John cried again. “Come on!” 

“| have to,” she said softly. She went to the wall and put 
her hands on it, as she’d done before. But this time the 
concrete was warm, and somehow smooth despite the 
rough finish. / have to get inside. For a moment, she felt like 
she was in two places at once: here, inside the little room, 
and on the other side of the wall, desperate to get through. 
She drew back suddenly, taking her hands off the wall as if 
it burned. The illusion flickered, then died altogether. 

The concrete wall was made of metal, and at the center 
was a door. 

Charlie stared, blank with shock. This is the door. She’d 
been drawing it without knowing what it was. Approximating 
over and over something she had never seen. She stepped 
forward again and put her hands on the surface. It was still 
warm. She pressed her cheek against it. “Are you in there?” 
She called softly. “I have to get you out.” 

Her heart was pounding, blood rushing in her ears so 
loudly she could scarcely hear anything else. “Charlie! 
Charlie!” John and Jessica were both calling her from 
outside, but their voices seemed as distant as memory. She 
stood, not taking her hands from the metal but tracing her 
fingers along it. It felt like letting go for even an instant 
would cause her pain. She brought her hands to the crack in 
the wall: it had no handle, no knob, and no hinges. It was 
just an outline, and now she ran her thumb up and down the 
side of it, trying to find a trip, some trick that would make 
the door open and let her through. 

She heard John climb back inside and slowly approach 
her, keeping his distance, as though he might scare her 


away. 

“Charlie, if you don’t get out of here, you'll die. 
Whatever’s behind that door, it can’t give you back your 
family. You still have us.” Charlie looked at John. His eyes 
were wide and frightened. She took a small step toward 
him. 

“We've lost enough. Please, don’t make me lose you, 
too,” John pleaded. Charlie stared at the ceiling as it 
trembled; clouds of smoke were pouring out of the corridor 
they’d come from. John coughed heavily; he was choking. 
She looked at him. He was terrified, unwilling to draw closer 
than he already was. 

She turned again, and the world around her faded; she 
couldn’t hear John behind her, or smell the smoke filling the 
air. She laid her hand flat against the wall. A heartbeat. | 
feel a heartbeat. Though she made no intentional 
movement, her body turned to the side. She tensed, 
committing to remain where she stood, without ever making 
the decision. Something began to hiss: the steady, gentle 
sound of air being released. From the base of the door came 
a rhythmic clicking. Charlie closed her eyes. 

“Charlie!” John grabbed her and turned her forcefully 
toward him, shaking her out of her stupor. “Look at me. I’m 
not leaving you here.” 

“| have to stay.” 

“No, you have to come with us!” he cried. “You have to 
come with me.” 

“No, |...” Charlie felt her voice trail off; she was losing 
strength. 

“| love you,” John said. Charlie’s eyes stopped drifting: 
she fixed them on him. “I’m taking you with me, right now.” 
He grabbed her hand roughly. He was strong enough to pull 


her away by force, she knew, but he was waiting for her to 
acknowledge him. 

She looked into his eyes, trying to let them bring her 
back. It felt like trying to awaken from a dream. John’s gaze 
was an anchor, and she held it, letting him keep her steady, 
draw her back to him. “Okay,” she said quietly. 

“Okay,” John repeated, heaving the words out in a sigh. 
He’d been holding his breath. He walked backward, guiding 
her as he went. 

She climbed to the top of the broken wall and paused, 
bracing herself against the insistent pull of the door and 
what lay behind it. She took a deep breath—then was torn 
backward by a colossal force. She ripped back through the 
rocks, her arms pinned to her sides. Charlie screamed, 
struggling to get away. Dimly she heard John shouting close 
by. 

As she whipped her body back and forth against its grip, 
Charlie glimpsed the immense thing that had caught her. 
The twisted Freddy stared blankly forward, or at least what 
remained of it. It held her with one arm; the other was gone, 
and wires hung from its shoulder like extra bits of sinew. Its 
plastic casing had melted away, and what remained were 
metal plates and stays, a skeleton with unnatural bulges 
and gaps in its frame where the collapse had mangled it. Its 
face was a gaping hole, spilling teeth and wire that hung in 
Shapeless masses. Charlie couldn’t see it legs, and after a 
second she realized they were gone. It had dragged itself, 
one-armed, through the rubble. Wires spilled out of its body 
like guts, and when she saw its stomach, Charlie went cold 
with terror. 

Its chest had parted at the middle. Sharp, uneven teeth 
lined both sides. Charlie kicked at the animatronic, but it did 


no good: it forced her instantly into the chasm. The thing 
embraced her, pushing her deeper inside its chest as they 
toppled backward together. The metal rib cage snapped 
shut: she was caught. 

“Charlie!” John was kneeling beside her, and she reached 
out through the metal stays. He grabbed her hand. “Clay!” 
he shouted, “Jessica!” Jessica was there in seconds; Charlie 
could see Clay struggling back through the narrow opening. 

“Wait!” Charlie cried as Jessica tried to pry the chest 
open. “The spring locks, they’ll kill me if you touch the 
wrong thing!” 

“But if we don’t get you out, you'll die anyway!” Jessica 
shouted. Charlie saw for the first time that the mouth wasn’t 
finished closing. It was layered somehow, and metal plates 
began folding over her like petals of a horrid flower. John 
started to stand, but Charlie tightened her hand around his. 

“Don’t let go of me!” she cried, panicked. He dropped 
back to his knees and pulled her hand to his chest. She 
stared at him, even as the metal plates closed over her, 
threatening to seal her off. Jessica tried to jam them 
delicately, without setting off the spring locks. “John—” 
Charlie gasped. 

“Don’t,” he said roughly. “I’ve got you!” 

The plates continued to slide down and meet in the 
center. Charlie’s arm was trapped in the corner of the 
strange mouth, protruding from the only gap where the 
plates didn’t meet. She looked around wildly: another layer 
was closing. She was wedged into the suit haphazardly, her 
whole body crammed into Freddy’s torso, and she could see 
nothing but dimming figures as more layers of metal and 
plastic closed over her. Above her, Jessica was trying to stop 


the next layer from emerging, and she felt Freddy’s 
mutilated body lurch. 

“Jessica! Look out!” she screamed at the top of her lungs. 
Jessica leaped back just in time to avoid Freddy’s violently 
Swinging arm. The animatronic was on its back, but it struck 
out randomly, beating Jessica and Clay away. Its body 
rocked back and forth, and Charlie eyed the springs and 
robotic parts all around her: she drew her knees up to her 
chest, trying to make herself smaller. 

John let go of her hand, and she grabbed at his absence. 
She could no longer see outside. “John!” 

Freddy’s body shook, struck by a massive blow. 


* OK OX 


“Let go of her!” John screamed. Clay hefted a metal beam 
from the ground and struck at Freddy’s head. The twisted 
bear tried to strike with its remaining arm. Clay ducked out 
of the way and hit it again from the other side, out of reach. 
Jessica was still at the creature’s chest, trying to find an 
opening to pry at, but each layer melded seamlessly 
together. There was nothing to catch at. John moved in next 
to her, trying to help. Clay struck at the head over and over, 
making Freddy’s whole body jolt with every blow. 

“I can’t get to her!” Jessica yelled. “She’s going to 
suffocate!” She tried to steady Charlie’s trembling hand. 
Clay hit Freddy’s head once more with a resounding crash, 
and they heard metal cracking as the head was knocked off 
the creature’s body. 

“Can we get her out through the neck?” John asked 
urgently. Freddy’s arm continued to flail, but it had 


weakened, and was just rising and falling, seeming to swing 
without purpose. 

“Clay, help!” Jessica cried. He ran to take over, digging 
his fingers between the plates to pry them open. Jessica 
continued holding Charlie’s hand, which had gone limp. 
“Charlie!” Jessica cried. Charlie’s hand closed over hers 
again, and Jessica gasped with relief. “John, Clay, she’s 
okay! Hurry! Charlie, can you hear me? It’s Jessica.” There 
was no sound from inside Freddy’s sealed chest, but Charlie 
held on tightly to Jessica’s hand as the others grimly worked 
to free her. 

Suddenly a single high-pitched click reverberated 
through the air. John and Clay froze, their hands still 
hovering above Freddy’s chest. For a moment, the air stood 
still, then the metal body convulsed violently. It launched 
itself off the ground, and a ghastly crunch of metal pierced 
the air. All three pulled back instinctively. Clay and John 
jumped away from the thing, and Jessica scrambled 
backward, dropping Charlie’s hand. 

The suit fell again and was still. The arm was splayed on 
the ground at an awkward angle. The room was silent. 
“Charlie?” John said softly, then his face went white. He ran 
to the place where her arm was exposed, falling hard on his 
knees, and grabbed her hand in both his own. It was limp. 
John turned it over and tapped her palm with his fingers. 
“Charlie? Charlie!” 

“John,” Jessica said very quietly. “The blood.” He looked 
up at her, confused, still holding on to Charlie. Then 
something wet dripped onto his hand. There was blood 
running out of the suit and down Charlie’s arm. Her skin was 
slick and red, except the hand he held. He watched, unable 
to look away, as it dripped steadily from the suit, pooling on 


the ground and beginning to seep into his jeans. It covered 
his hand and hers, until his skin was slippery and he began 
to lose his grip. She was sliding away from him. 

Sirens were suddenly nearby, and John realized vaguely 
that he’d been hearing them in the distance. He looked 
dazedly up at Clay. 

“| radioed them,” he said. “We aren’t safe in here.” Clay 
took his eyes off the suit and looked up to study the ceiling. 
It was bowed and cracking, on the verge of collapse. John 
didn’t move. People were shouting outside, and flashlights 
bobbed up and down as they ran toward the crumbling 
building. Jessica touched his shoulder. Breaks and cracks 
resounded through the space. 

“John, we have to.” As if to mark her point, the floor 
shook again beneath them and something crashed loudly 
not far away. Charlie’s hand didn’t move. 

A uniformed officer pressed through the crack in the wall. 
“Chief Burke?” 

“Thomson. We have to get the kids out, now.” Thomson 
nodded and motioned to Jessica. 

“Come on, miss.” 

“John, come on,” Jessica managed to say, anda 
thunderous clatter sounded from behind them. Clay looked 
to the officer again. 

“Get them out of here.” Thomson took hold of Jessica’s 
arm and she tried to shove him away. 

“Don’t touch me!” she shouted, but the officer firmly 
pulled her up and over the rubble, half dragging her outside. 
John only half heard the commotion, then someone’s hands 
were on his shoulders as well. He batted them away, not 
looking around. 

“We're leaving,” Clay said in a low voice. 


“Not without Charlie,” John responded. Clay took a deep 
breath. 

John saw him signal someone from the corner of his eye, 
then he was grabbed forcefully by two large men and 
dragged toward the opening. 

“No!” he shouted. “Let me go!” They shoved him roughly 
over the broken wall, then Clay struggled out behind them. 

“Is everyone out?” a female officer called. 

“Yes,” Clay said hesitantly, but with the ring of authority. 

“NO!” John shouted. He broke free of the officers holding 
him back and ran for the opening again. He had one foot 
through the gap, then stopped dead as a sweeping 
flashlight briefly illuminated the room in front of him. 

A dark-haired woman knelt in the pool of blood, holding 
Charlie’s limp hand. She looked up sharply and met his eyes 
with a piercing black gaze. Before John could move or speak, 
hands grabbed his shoulders again and drew him back, and 
then the whole house collapsed before them. 





We don’t know for sure,” Jessica said, firmly setting down 
the fork she’d been playing with on the diner table. It made 
a disappointing click. 

“Don’t do this,” John warned. He didn’t look up from the 
menu, though he hadn’t read a word since he picked it up. 

“It’s just, all that we saw was, you know, blood. People 
can survive a lot of things. Dave—Springtrap, whatever he 
wants to call himself—he survived one of those suits, twice. 
For all we know she might be trapped in the rubble. We 
should go back. We could—” 

“Jessica, stop.” John closed the menu and put it down on 
the table. “Please. | can’t listen to this. We both saw it 
happen. We both know she couldn’t have ...” Jessica opened 
her mouth again, about to interrupt. “I said, stop. Don’t you 
think that | want to believe that she’s okay? | cared about 


her, too. | cared about her a lot. There is nothing | want 
more than for her to somehow have escaped. For her to 
drive up in that ancient car and get out all furious and say, 
‘Hey, why’d you leave me behind?’ But we saw the blood: 
there was too much. | held her hand, and it didn’t feel like 
anything. As soon as | touched her, | just—Jessica, | knew. 
And you know it, too.” 

Jessica picked up her fork again and twirled it between 
her fingers, not meeting his eyes. “I feel like we’re waiting 
for something to happen,” she said quietly. 

John picked up the menu again. “I Know. But | think that’s 
just how this feels.” From behind him, he heard the waitress 
approach for the third time. “We don’t know yet,” he said 
without looking up. “Why am | even looking at this?” John 
set the menu back down and covered his face with his 
hands. 

“Can | join you?” John looked up. An unfamiliar, brown- 
haired young man slid into the booth next to Jessica and 
across from John. 

“Hey, Arty,” Jessica said with a weak smile. 

“Hey,” he said, glancing from her to John and back again. 
John said nothing. “Everyone okay?” Arty asked finally. “1 
heard there was some kind of accident. Where’s Charlie?” 

Jessica looked down, tapping the fork on the table. John 
met the newcomer’s eyes, then shook his head. Arty 
blanched, and John looked out the window. The parking lot 
outside blurred as he fixed his gaze on the smudged and 
streaky glass. 

“The last thing she said to me was...” John lightly 
touched his fist to the table. “‘Don’t let go of me.’” He 
turned back to the window. 

“John,” Jessica whispered. 


“And | did. | let go of her. And she died alone.” There was 
silence for a few moments. 

“| can’t believe it,” Arty said, his brow furrowed. “We had 
just started dating, you know?” 

Jessica kept her face smooth, and John turned his 
thousand-yard stare on Arty. The boy faltered. “I mean, we 
were going to. | think. She really liked me, anyway.” He 
looked to Jessica, who nodded. 

“She liked you, Arty,” she said. John turned back to the 
window. 

“I’m sure she did,” he said evenly. 

Random thoughts swirled through his mind. The mess of 
her room. The pang of concern when he saw her childhood 
toy, Theodore the stuffed rabbit, torn apart. Charlie, what 
was wrong? There was so much more he wanted to ask her. 
Those blind faces with their smooth, nearly featureless faces 
and their couplet word games. Something—everything— 
about them had disturbed him, and now that he pictured 
them again, he was bothered for another reason. They 
looked like William Afton’s designs—the blank faces with no 
eyes. Charlie, what made you think of that? 

Jessica made an indistinct cry, and John startled back to 
the present to see her racing to the door, where Marla had 
appeared. He got up more slowly and followed her, with a 
sense of déja vu. He was waiting his turn as Marla hugged 
Jessica close, stroking her hair and whispering something 
John couldn’t hear. 

Marla released Jessica and turned to him. “John,” she 
said, taking both his hands. The sorrow in her eyes was 
what broke him. He leaned in and hugged her close, hiding 
his face in her hair until he could compose himself. When his 
breathing had steadied, she pushed him gently back and 


took his arm. They all went back to the table where Arty 
waited, peering uncertainly over the side of the booth. They 
sat down again. Marla slid in next to John and looked from 
him to Jessica. “You have to tell me what happened,” she 
said quietly. Jessica nodded, letting her hair fall over her 
face for a minute in a shiny brown curtain. 

“Yeah, | want to know, too,” Arty piped up, and Marla 
glanced at him as if only just registering his presence. 

“Hi,” she said, sounding slightly puzzled. “I’m Marla.” 

“Arty. Charlie and | were—” He glanced at John. “We were 
good friends.” 

Marla nodded. “Well, | wish we were meeting under 
different circumstances. Jessica? John? Please, tell me.” 

They glanced at each other. John looked to the window 
again. He was content to let Jessica do the talking but felt 
an obligation—not to talk to Marla, but to talk about Charlie. 
“Charlie was chasing something from her past,” John said, 
his voice calm. “She found it, and it didn’t let her leave.” 

“There was a building collapse,” Jessica added. “Her 
father’s house.” 

“Charlie didn’t make it out,” John said roughly. He cleared 
his throat and reached for the glass of water in front of him. 

John vaguely heard Marla and Jessica exchanging words 
of comfort, but his mind was elsewhere. The woman, 
kneeling in the pool of Charlie’s blood, holding her hand. He 
had only glimpsed her for a moment; she had looked almost 
as surprised to see him as he was to see her. But there was 
something familiar about her. 

He turned away from the others again and closed his 
eyes, trying to picture it. Dark hair, dark eyes. She looked 
severe and unafraid, even with the ground shaking and the 
building tumbling down over her head. | know her. The 


woman he remembered looked different, younger, but her 
face was the same ... Suddenly he had it. The last day | saw 
you, Charlie, back when we were kids. She came to pick you 
up from school, and the next day you weren't there, and the 
next day, and the day after that. Then even us kids began to 
hear the rumors, that your father had done what he did. And 
that’s when | realized | would never see you again. John 
shivered. 

“John, what’s wrong?” Marla said sharply, then blushed. 
“lI mean, what are you thinking?” 

“Her aunt was there,” he said slowly. “Her aunt Jen.” 

“What?” Marla said. “Where?” 

“They hadn’t spoken in months,” Jessica said doubtfully. 

“| know,” John said. “But she was there. When | ran back, 
just before they pulled me away, | saw her. With Charlie.” 

The thought struck him like a blow across the chest, and 
he looked out the window again so that he wouldn’t have to 
meet anyone’s eyes. “Charlie’s aunt Jen was there,” he 
repeated to the dirty pane of glass. 

“Maybe Clay called her,” Jessica offered. John didn’t 
respond. No one spoke for a long moment. 

“I think it’s best not to look for more mysteries,” Marla 
said slowly. “Charlie was—” 

“Are you all ready to order?” The waitress asked brightly. 
John turned to look at her with impatience in his eyes, but 
Marla cut him off. 

“Four coffees,” she said firmly. “Four eggs and toast, 
scrambled.” 

“Thanks, Marla,” John whispered. “I’m not sure if | can 
eat, though.” 

She glanced at the rest of them. Arty looked briefly as if 
he wanted to say something, then he cast his eyes down at 


the table. The woman departed, and Marla looked around. 
“We all have to eat. And you can’t sit around in a diner all 
day without ordering anything.” 

“I’m glad you’re here, Marla,” John said. She nodded. 

“We all love Charlie,” she said, looking at each of them in 
turn. “There’s never a right thing to say, is there? Nothing 
ever makes it okay, because it’s not.” 

“All those crazy experiments,” Jessica said suddenly. “| 
didn’t understand, but she was so excited about them, and 
now she'll never get to finish.” 

“It’s not fair,” Marla said softly. 

“So what do we do?” Jessica said with a plaintive note in 
her voice. She looked at Marla like she must have the 
answer. 

“Jessica, sweetie,” Marla said. “All anyone can do is hold 
on to the Charlie that we all loved.” 

“It’s over,” John said hoarsely, turning away from the 
window abruptly. “That ... that psychopath murdered her, 
just like he did Michael and all those other kids. She was the 
most fascinating, the most amazing person | have ever 
known, and she died for nothing.” 

“She did not die for nothing!” Marla snapped, leaning in 
toward him. Rage flashed in her eyes. “No one dies for 
nothing, John. Everyone's life has a meaning. Everyone has 
a death, and | hate it that this was hers. Do you hear me? | 
hate it! But we can’t change it. All we can do is remember 
Charlie, and honor Charlie’s life, from the beginning to the 
very end.” 

John held her stormy gaze for a long moment, then broke 
away and looked down at his folded hands on the table. She 
mirrored the movement and placed one hand over his. 


Jessica gasped, and he turned back to the table wearily. 
“What, Jessica?” John asked. Her nervous energy was 
beginning to exhaust him. She didn’t answer, but gave him 
an incredulous look, and turned back to the window. Marla 
leaned past John, craning her neck to see. Reluctantly he 
looked, too, letting his eyes focus for the first time on the 
parking lot outside the window, and not the pane of glass 
itself. 

It was a car. The woman driving killed the engine and got 
out. She was slim and tall, with long, straight brown hair 
that glistened in the sun. She was wearing a bright red, 
knee-length dress with black combat boots, and she strode 
purposefully toward the diner. They all watched motionless, 
as if the slightest sound might rupture the illusion and send 
her away. The woman was almost at the door. Arty said it 
first: 

“Charlie?” 

Marla shook her head. She leaped up and turned, calling 
from the seat, “Charlie!” 

She ran for the door, and Jessica was quick on her heels, 
crying out after her. They rushed to the doorway to meet 
her just as she walked in. 

John stayed where he was, craning his neck to see the 
door. Arty seemed confused, his mouth open slightly and his 
brow furrowed. John watched for a steady moment, then 
turned away decisively, facing across the table with a grave 
expression. He didn’t speak until Arty met his gaze. 

“That’s not Charlie.”
