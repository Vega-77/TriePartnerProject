"Charlie!” John clambered through the rubble toward the 
place where she’d been, choking on the dust of the 
explosion. The ruins shifted beneath his feet, and he 
stumbled over a block of concrete and caught himself just 
before falling, scraping his hands raw as he grabbed 
frantically at the broken surface. He reached it, the place 
where she’d been—he could feel her presence beneath him. 
He took hold of an immense block of concrete and hefted it 
with all his strength. He managed to tilt it from the pile and 
overturn it, where it fell with a thud, rattling the ground he 
stood on. Over his head, a steel beam creaked, wavering 
precariously. 

“Charlie!” John cried her name again as he shoved 
another block of concrete away. “Charlie, |’m coming!” He 
was gasping for breath, moving the remains of the house 


with desperate, adrenaline-fueled strength, but the 
adrenaline was running thin. He set his jaw and pressed on. 
His palms slipped as he tried to lift the next block, and when 
he looked he realized, dazedly, that his hands left streaks of 
blood wherever they touched. He wiped his palms on his 
Jeans and tried again. This time the broken concrete moved, 
and he balanced it on his thighs and took it three steps 
away, then dropped it on a pile of debris. It crashed down 
onto the rubble and shattered rock and glass beneath it, 
starting an avalanche of its own, and then, beneath the 
sounds of wreckage, he heard her whisper: “... John...” 

“Charlie ...” His heart stopped beating as he whispered 
back to her, and again the rubble moved under his feet. This 
time he fell, landing hard on his back, knocking the wind out 
of him. He struggled to inhale, his lungs useless, then 
haltingly he began to breathe. He sat up, light-headed, and 
saw what the collapse had revealed: He was in the little, 
hidden room in Charlie’s childhood house. Before him was a 
plain, smooth metal wall. At the center was a door. 

It was only an outline, without hinges or a handle, but he 
knew what it was because Charlie had known, when she 
stopped running in the midst of their escape, and pressed 
her cheek against the surface, calling to someone, or 
something, inside. 

“John...” she whispered his name again, and the 
sound seemed to come from everywhere at once, bouncing 
off the walls of the room. John got to his feet and put his 
hands on the door; it was cool to the touch. He pressed his 
cheek to it, just as Charlie had, and it grew colder, like it 
was draining the warmth from his skin. John pulled back and 
rubbed the cold spot on his face, still watching the door as 
the shiny metal began to dull before his eyes. Its color paled 


and then the door itself began to thin, its solidity vanishing 
until it looked like frosted glass, and John saw there was a 
shadow behind the glass, the figure of a person. The figure 
stepped closer, the door clarifying until he could almost see 
through it. He moved closer, mirroring the figure on the 
other side. It had a face, sleek and polished, its eyes like a 
statue’s, sculpted, but unseeing. John peered through the 
door between them, his breath clouding the near- 
transparent barrier, then suddenly the eyes snapped open. 

The figure stood placidly before him, the eyes fixed on 
nothing. They were clouded, and unmoving—dead. 
Someone laughed, a frantic, mirthless sound that echoed in 
the small, sealed room, and John looked wildly around for 
the source. The laughter rose in pitch, growing louder and 
louder. John covered his ears with his hands as the piercing 
noise became unbearable. “CHARLIE!” he cried again. 

John jerked awake, his heart racing: the laughter went 
on, following him out of the dream. Disoriented, his eyes 
darted around the room, then lit on the TV, where a clown’s 
painted face filled the screen, caught in a convulsive fit of 
laughter. John sat up, rubbing his cheek where his watch 
had been pressing into it. He checked the time, then 
breathed a sigh of relief—he had just enough time to get to 
work. He sat back, taking a moment to catch his breath. On 
the TV screen, a local news anchor was holding a mic up for 
a man dressed as a circus clown, complete with a painted 
face, a red nose, and a rainbow-colored wig. Around his 
neck was a collar that looked like it belonged ina 
Renaissance painting, and he was wearing a full yellow 
clown suit, with red pompoms for buttons. 

“So, tell me,” the anchor said brightly. “Did you already 
have this costume, or did you make it especially for the 


grand opening?” 
John switched the TV off, and headed for the shower. 


* OK OX 


He’d been at it all day, but the noise was still unbearable: a 
rattling, clanging din punctuated by shouts and the 
intermittent, earthshaking clatter of jackhammers. John 
closed his eyes, trying to blot it out: the vibrations 
resounded in his chest, filling him up, and amid the noise 
the sound of desperate laughter suddenly rang in his ears. 
The figure from his dream came to him again, just out of 
sight, and he felt as though, if he just turned his head the 
right way, he could see the face behind the door ... 

“John!” 

John turned: Luis was standing a foot away, giving him a 
puzzled stare. “I called your name three times,” he said. 
John shrugged, gesturing at the chaos around them. 

“Hey, some of the guys are going out after this; you 
coming?” Luis asked. John hesitated. “Come on, it’ll be good 
for you—all you do is work and sleep.” He laughed good- 
naturedly and slapped John on the shoulder. 

“Right, good for me.” John smiled back, then looked at 
the ground as the expression faded. “I just have so much 
going on right now.” He tried to sound convincing. 

“Right, lot’s going on. Just let me know if you change 
your mind.” He clapped John on the shoulder again and 
headed back to the forklift. John watched him stride away. It 
hadn’t been the first time John had turned them down; not 
the second time or the third; and it occurred to him that 
eventually they would stop trying. That there’d be a 


moment when they would all just give up. Maybe that would 
be for the best. 

“John!” another voice called. 

Now what? 

It was the foreman, shouting at him from the door of his 
standalone office, a trailer that had been brought onsite for 
the duration of the construction and sat precariously ona 
dirt ledge. 

John trudged across the construction zone, ducking 
through a vinyl sheet in the trailer’s doorway. Moments later 
he was standing across a folding table from the foreman, 
the plastic wood-textured paneling barely holding to the 
walls surrounding him. 

“I’ve got a couple guys out there telling me you’re 
distracted.” 

“I’m just focused on my job, that’s all,” John said, forcing 
a smile and trying to prevent his frustration from leaking 
out. Oliver smiled, unconvincingly. 

“Focused,” Oliver mimicked. John dropped the smile, 
startled. Oliver sighed. “Look, | gave you a chance because 
your cousin said you’re a hard worker. | overlooked the fact 
that you walked off your last job and never came back. You 
know | took a risk on you?” 

John swallowed. “Yes, sir, | know.” 

“Stop with the ‘sir.’ Just listen to me.” 

“Look, | do what I’m told. | don’t understand the 
problem.” 

“Your reactions are slow; you look like you’re 
daydreaming out there. You're not a team player. 

“What?” 

“This is an active construction zone. If you’re in la-la 
land, or you’re not thinking about the safety of the other 


” 


men out there, someone's going to get hurt, or killed. I’m 
not saying you have to share secrets and braid one 
another’s hair; I’m saying you have to be on the team. They 
have to trust that you’re not going to let them down when it 
counts.” John gave an understanding nod. “This is a good 
job, John. | think these are good guys out there, too. Work 
isn’t easy to come by these days, and | need you to get your 
head in the game. Because next time | see it in the clouds 
... Well, just don’t put me in that position. Understand?” 

“Yeah, | understand,” John said numbly. He didn’t move, 
standing on the shag brown carpet that came with the 
portable office as though waiting to be dismissed from 
detention. 

“Okay. Get out.” John went. The dressing-down had taken 
up the last few minutes of his workday; he helped Sergei put 
away some of the equipment, then headed to his car with a 
muttered good-bye. 

“Hey!” Sergei called after him. John stopped. “Last call!” 

“l...” John broke off, spotting Oliver out of the corner of 
his eye. “Maybe next time,” he said. 

Sergei pressed. “Come on, it’s my excuse to avoid that 
new kid’s place—my daughter’s been begging to go there 
all week. Lucy’s taking her, but robots creep me out.” 

John paused, and the world grew silent around him. 
“What place?” John said. 

“So, you coming?” Sergei asked again. 

John took a few steps backward, as if he’d come too close 
to a ledge. “Maybe another time,” John said, and walked 
decidedly to his car. It was old and brownish-red, something 
that might have been cool in high school. Now it was just a 
reminder that he was still a kid who hadn’t moved on, a 
mark of status that had become a mark of shame within the 


space of a year. He sat heavily, a plume of dust shooting out 
the sides of the car seat as he dropped onto it. His hands 
were Shaking. “Get a grip.” He closed his eyes, and clutched 
the wheel, steadying himself. “This is life now, and you can 
do it,” he whispered, then opened his eyes and sighed. 
“Sounds like something lame my dad would have said.” He 
turned the key. 

The drive home should have been ten minutes; but the 
route he took was closer to half an hour, as it avoided 
driving through town. If he didn’t drive through town, there 
was no risk of running into people he didn’t want to talk to. 
More importantly, he didn’t risk running into the people he 
did want to talk to. Be a team player. He couldn’t muster 
real resentment toward Oliver. John wasn’t a team player, 
not anymore. For almost six months, he had been coming 
and going from home to work like a train on a track, 
stopping to buy food now and then, but not much else. He 
spoke only when necessary; avoided eye contact. He was 
startled when people spoke to him, whether they were 
coworkers saying hello, or strangers asking the time. He 
made conversation, but he was getting better at speaking 
while walking away. He was always polite, while also making 
it clear he had somewhere to be—made obvious, when 
necessary, by suddenly turning in the opposite direction. 
Sometimes he felt like he was fading away, and it was 
jarring, and disappointing, to be reminded that he could still 
be seen. 

He pulled into the lot of his apartment complex, a two- 
story building not really meant for long-term tenants. There 
was a light in the window of the manager’s office: he had 
tried for a month to track the open hours, then given up, 
concluding that there was no pattern. 


He grabbed an envelope from the glove compartment 
and headed toward the door. He knocked, and there was no 
response, though inside he could hear sounds of movement. 
He knocked again, and this time the door opened partially: 
an old woman with the skin of a lifelong smoker peered out 
at him. “Hey, Delia.” John smiled; she didn’t smile back. 
“Rent check.” John handed an envelope to her. “I know it’s 
late. | came by yesterday, but no one was here.” 

“Was it during business hours?” Delia peered into the 
envelope carefully as though suspicious of what might be 
inside. 

“The lights were off, So...” 

“Then it wasn’t during business hours.” Delia bared her 
teeth, but it wasn’t really a smile. “Il Saw you hung up a 
plant,” she said abruptly. 

“Oh yeah.” John peered over his shoulder toward his 
apartment, as though he might be able to see it from where 
they stood. “It’s nice to take care of something, right?” John 
tried to smile again but quickly gave up, engulfed ina 
vacuum of judgment that allowed for no levity. “That’s 
allowed, right? To have a plant?” 

“Yes, you can have a plant.” Delia took a step back inside 
and looked poised to close the door. “People don’t usually 
settle in here, that’s all. Usually there is a house, then a 
wife, and then the plant.” 

“Right.” John looked down at his shoes. “It’s just been a 
rough”—he began, but the door closed with a firm thunk 
—“vyear.” 

John considered the door for a minute, then headed to 
the ground-floor apartment at the front of the complex, now 
his for another month. It was a single-bedroom unit with a 
full bath and half a kitchen. He kept the blinds up while he 


was away, to show that he had nothing: the area was prone 
to burglaries, and it seemed like a safe bet to telegraph the 
fact that there was nothing to steal here. 

Once inside, John locked the door behind him and 
carefully slid the chain into place. His apartment was cool 
and dark, and quiet. He sighed and rubbed his temples; the 
headache was still there, but he was growing accustomed to 
that. 

The place was sparsely furnished—it had come that way 
—and the only personal touch he had added to the living 
room was to stack four cardboard boxes full of books against 
the wall below the window. He glanced at them with a 
disappointed familiarity. He went to the bedroom and sat 
down on his bed, the springs creaking stiffly beneath him. 
He didn’t bother turning on the light; there was enough 
daylight still leaking through the small dingy window above 
his bed. 

John looked toward his dresser, where a familiar face 
looked back at him: a toy rabbit’s head, its body nowhere to 
be found. 

“What did you do today?” John said, meeting the plush 
rabbit’s eyes as if it might show a spark of recognition. 
Theodore just stared back blankly, his eyes dark and 
lifeless. “You look terrible; worse than me.” John stood and 
approached the rabbit’s head; he couldn’t ignore the smell 
of mothballs and dirty fabric. John’s smile faded, and he 
grabbed the head by the ears and held it in the air. Time to 
throw you away. He considered it almost every day. He 
clenched his jaw, then set it back on the dresser carefully 
and turned away, not wanting to look at it further. 


* OK OX 


He closed his eyes, not expecting sleep to come, but hop- 
ing. He hadn’t slept well the night before, or the night 
before that. He had come to dread sleep; he put it off as 
long as he could, walking miles of road until late at night, 
returning home and trying to read, or just staring at the 
wall. The familiarity was frustrating. He grabbed his pillow 
and went back to the living room. He lay down on the couch, 
swinging his legs over the arm so he could fit. The silence in 
the little apartment was beginning to ring in his ears, and he 
grabbed the remote off the floor and turned on the TV. The 
screen was black and white, and the reception was terrible: 
he could scarcely make out faces through the static, but the 
chatter of what sounded like a talk show was rapid and 
cheerful. He turned the volume low and settled back, staring 
at the ceiling and half listening to the television voices until 
slowly, he drifted into sleep. 

Her arm was limp, the only part of her he could see 
dangling from the twisted metal suit. Blood ran in red rivers 
down her skin, pooling on the ground. Charlie was all alone. 
He could hear her voice again if he tried: “Don’t let go! 
John!” She called my name. And then that thing—He 
shuddered, hearing again the sound of the animatronic suit 
snapping and crunching. He stared at Charlie’s lifeless arm 
as if the world around them had disappeared, and as the 
noise echoed in his head, his mind conjured up thoughts 
unbidden: The crunching sounds were her bones. The 
tearing was everything else. 

John opened his eyes with a start. A few feet away, a 
studio audience laughed, and he looked at the TV, its static 
and chatter bringing him back to waking life. 

John sat up, rolling his neck to work out kinks: the couch 
was too small, and his back was cramped. His head ached, 


and he was exhausted but restless, the shot of adrenaline 
still working its way through his system. He went out, 
locking the door forcefully behind him, and breathed in the 
night air. 

He started down the road, heading toward town and 
whatever might still be open. The lights on the road were far 
apart, and there was no sidewalk, just a shallow dirt 
shoulder. Few cars passed him, but when they did, they 
loomed up from around corners or cresting hills, blinding 
him with headlights and rushing by with a force that 
sometimes threatened to knock him back. He had begun to 
notice himself edging ever closer to the road as he walked, 
playing a halfhearted game of chicken. When he found 
himself too far out, he would always take deliberate steps 
back to the shoulder, and it was always with a secret, 
sinking disappointment in himself that he would do so. 

As he approached town, lights pierced the darkness once 
again, and he shielded his eyes and took a step back from 
the road. This one slowed as it passed, then came to a 
sudden stop. John turned and walked a few steps toward it 
as the driver’s window rolled down. 

“John?” someone called. The car went into reverse and 
haphazardly pulled onto the shoulder; John jumped out of its 
path. A woman stepped out and took a few quick steps 
toward him, as if she might try to hug him, but he stayed 
planted where he was, his arms stiff at his sides, and she 
stopped a few feet away. “John, it’s me!” Jessica said with a 
smile that quickly faded. “What are you doing out here?” 
she asked. She was wearing short sleeves, and she rubbed 
her arms against the night air, glancing back and forth 
along the near-deserted road. 


“Well, | could ask you the same thing,” he answered as 
though she had accused him of something. Jessica pointed 
over John’s shoulder. “Gas.” She smiled brightly at him, and 
he couldn’t help but mirror her a little. He had almost 
forgotten this ability of hers, to turn on cheerful goodwill like 
a faucet, splashing it all over everyone. “How have you 
been?” she asked cautiously. 

“Fine. Working, mostly.” He gestured down at the dusty 
work clothes he hadn’t bothered to change out of. “What’s 
new with you?” he asked, suddenly aware of the absurdity 
of the conversation as cars passed nearby. “I really have to 
be going. Have a good night.” He turned and began to walk 
away without giving her a chance to speak. 

“I miss seeing you around,” Jessica called. “And so does 
she.” 

John paused, digging at the dirt with one foot. 

“Listen.” Jessica took a few quick steps to catch up to 
him. “Carlton’s going to be in town for a couple of weeks; 
it’s spring break. We’re all getting together.” She waited 
expectantly, but he didn’t respond. 

“He’s dying to show off his new cosmopolitan persona,” 
Jessica added brightly. “When | talked to him on the phone 
last week, he was faking a Brooklyn accent to see if I’d 
notice.” She forced a giggle. John smiled fleetingly. 

“Who else is going to be there?” he asked, looking 
directly at her for the first time since she got out of the car. 
Jessica’s eyes narrowed. 

“John, you have to talk to her sometime.” 

“Why is that?” he said brusquely, and started walking 
again. 

“John, wait!” Behind him, John heard her break into a run. 
She caught up quickly, slowing to jog beside him, matching 


his pace. “I can do this all day,” she warned, but John didn’t 
answer. 

“You have to talk to her,” Jessica repeated. He gave her a 
Sharp look. 

“Charlie’s dead,” he said harshly, the words rasping in 
his throat. It had been a long time since he spoke the words 
aloud. Jessica stopped in her tracks; he kept going. 

“John, at least talk to me.” 

He didn’t answer. 

“You're hurting her,” she added. He stopped walking. 
“Don’t you understand what you’re doing to her? After what 
she went through? It’s insane, John. | don’t Know what that 
night did to you, but | Know what it did to Charlie. And you 
know what? | don’t think anything hurt as badly as having 
you refuse to speak to her. To say she’s dead.” 

“| saw her die.” John stared out into the city lights. 

“No, you didn’t,” Jessica said, then hesitated. “Look, I’m 
worried about you.” 

“I’m just lost.” John turned to her. “And after what I’ve 
been through, after what we’ve been through, that’s not an 
unreasonable reaction.” He waited a moment for her to 
respond, then looked away. 

“| get it. | really do. | thought she was dead, too.” John 
opened his mouth to speak, but she pressed on. “I thought 
she was dead until she turned up, a/ive.” Jessica pulled at 
John’s shoulder until he met her eyes again. “I’ve seen her,” 
Jessica said, her voice breaking. “I’ve talked to her. It /s her. 
And this ...” She let go of his shoulder and waved her hand 
over him as though casting a spell. “7his thing that you’re 
doing, that’s what’s killing her.” 

“It’s not her,” John whispered. 


“Okay,” Jessica snapped, and turned on her heel. She 
walked back to the car and after a few moments, pulled 
back out into the road, then made a screeching U-turn. John 
stayed where he was. Jessica roared past him, then stopped 
abruptly, her breaks squealing, then backed up to where he 
stood. “We’re meeting at Clay’s house on Saturday,” she 
said tiredly. “Please.” He looked at her; she wasn’t crying, 
but her eyes were shiny, her face red. He nodded. 

“Maybe.” 

“Good enough for me. I'll see you there!” Jessica said, 
then she drove off without another word, the engine roaring 
in the quiet of the night. 

“| said maybe,” John muttered into the darkness. 





The pencil squeaked against the paper as the man at the 
desk carefully filled out the form in front of him. He paused 
suddenly, a wave of dizziness overtaking him. The letters on 
the page were fuzzy, and he adjusted his reading glasses, 
his head swimming. The glasses made no difference, and he 
took them off and rubbed his eyes. Then, just as suddenly 
as it had come, the sensation was gone: the room righted 
itself, and the words on the page were perfectly clear. He 
scratched his beard, still disconcerted, then began to 
steadily write again. A ring sounded and the front door 
opened. 

“Yes, sir?” he barked without looking up. 

“! wanted to have a look around the yard.” A woman’s 
voice echoed softly. 


“Oh, pardon me, ma’am.” The man looked up and smiled 
momentarily, then went back to his form, writing as he 
talked. “Scrap is fifty cents a pound. It might be more if you 
find a specific part, but we can see when you come back in. 
Just go have a look around; you have to bring your own 
tools, but we can help you load it up when you’re ready to 
leave.” 

“I’m looking for something specific.” The woman peered 
down at him, observing his name tag. “Bob,” she added 
belatedly. 

“Well, | don’t Know what to tell you.” He set his pencil 
down, then reclined and crossed his arms behind his head. 
“It’s a dump.” He laughed. “We try to at least separate the 
junk cars from the tin cans, but what you see is what you 
get.” 

“Bob, you received several truckloads of scrap metal on 
this date, and from this location.” The woman set a piece of 
paper down on top of the form Bob had been working on. 
Bob picked it up and adjusted his reading glasses, then 
looked up at her over them. 

“Well, as | said; it’s a dump,” he said slowly, growing 
more concerned as the moments passed. “I might be able to 
point you in the right direction; | mean, we don’t catalog the 
Stuff.” 

The woman walked around the side of the desk, stepping 
up beside Bob’s chair, and he straightened nervously in his 
seat. “| hear you boys had some trouble here last night,” 
she said casually. 

“No trouble.” Bob furrowed his brow. “Some kids snuck 
in; it happens.” 

“That’s not what | heard.” The woman studied a picture 
on the wall. “Your daughters?” She asked lightly. 


“Yes, two and five.” 

“They are beautiful.” She paused. “Do you treat them 
well?” Bob was taken aback. 

“Of course, | do,” he said, trying to hide his indignation. 
There was a long pause; the woman tilted her head, still 
looking at the picture. 

“| heard you called the police because you thought 
someone was trapped in the scrap heaps out there,” she 
said. Bob didn’t answer. “I heard”—the woman continued, 
leaning in closer to the picture—“that you thought you 
heard screaming, and sounds of distress and panic. 
Something was trapped; a child was trapped, you thought. 
Maybe several.” 

“Look, we run a clean business and we have a good 
reputation.” 

“I’m not disputing your reputation. Quite the opposite. | 
think what you did was honorable, running to the rescue in 
the middle of the night, cutting your legs on jagged scraps 
of metal as you ran blindly through the yard.” 

“How do you ...” Bob’s voice trembled, and he stopped 
talking. He moved his legs under the desk, hoping to hide 
the bandages that bulged out visibly under both pant legs. 

“What did you find?” the woman asked. 

He didn’t answer. 

“What was there?” she pressed. “When you got on your 
hands and knees and crawled through the beams and the 
wire? What was there?” 

“Nothing,” he whispered. “Nothing was there.” 

“And the police? They found nothing?” 

“No, nothing. There wasn’t anything. | went out again 
today just to be ...” He spread his hands on the desk in front 
of him, collecting his nerves. “We run a good business,” he 


said firmly. “Il don’t feel comfortable talking about this. If I’m 
in some kind of trouble, then | think—” 

“You're not in any trouble, Bob, as long as you can do me 
one little favor.” 

“What's that?” 

“Simple.” The woman leaned over Bob, bracing herself 
on the arms of his chair, so close her face almost touched 
his. “Take me there.” 


John pulled into the parking lot at the construction site and 
immediately saw Oliver standing in front of the gate of the 
chain-link fence. His arms were crossed, and he was 
chewing on something, his face grim. When it became clear 
that he wasn’t going to move out of the way, John slowed to 
a stop and got out. 

“What's going on?” he asked. Oliver continued to chew 
on whatever was in his mouth. 

“| have to let you go,” he said at last. “You're late, 
again.” 

“I’m not late,” John protested, then glanced at his watch. 
“I mean, not by much,” he amended. “Come on, Oliver. It 
won't happen again, I’m sorry.” 

“Me too,” Oliver said. “Good luck, John.” 

“Oliver!” John called. Oliver let himself in through the 
gate and glanced back one more time before walking away. 
John leaned against his car for a moment. Several coworkers 
were staring at him, suddenly turning away as John noticed 
them. John got in his car and headed back the way he had 
come. 


When he returned to his apartment, John sat down on the 
edge of his bed and buried his face in his hands. “Now 
what?” he wondered aloud, and glanced around the room. 
His eyes lit on his only decoration. “You still look terrible,” 
he said to Theodore’s disembodied head. “And you’re still in 
worse shape than me.” The notion of attending the party 
that night suddenly returned to him. The thought of it set off 
a nervous fluttering in his stomach, but he wasn’t sure what 
it was—anxiety, or excitement. / thought she was dead, too, 
Jessica had said the night before. /’ve seen her. I’ve talked 
to her. It is her. 

John closed his eyes. What if it is her? He saw it again, 
the moment he always saw: the shuddering suit, Charlie 
trapped inside as it crunched and jerked—and then her 
hand, and the blood. She couldn’t have survived that. But 
another image came to mind, unbidden—Dave, who became 
Springtrap: he had survived what happened to Charlie. He 
had worn the yellow rabbit suit like it was a second skin, and 
had paid for it twice: the scars that covered his torso like a 
shirt of gruesome lace told the story of one narrow escape, 
and the second ... Charlie had killed him when she tripped 
the spring locks, or so they all believed. No one could have 
survived what they saw. And yet, he had returned. For an 
instant, John pictured Charlie, scarred and broken, yet, 
miraculously, alive. “But that doesn’t sound like the person 
Jessica saw,” John spoke clearly to Theodore. “Someone 
broken and scarred; that’s not who Jessica was describing.” 
He shook his head. “That’s not the person | saw at the 
diner.” 

The next day—she looked like she’d just stepped out of a 
fairy tale. John caught himself and shook his head, trying to 
focus on the present. He really didn’t know what had 


happened to Charlie. He felt himself edging toward the 
glimmer of hope. Maybe | was wrong. Maybe she’s all right. 
It was what he’d wished for—what anyone wishes for in the 
throes of grief: Let it not have happened. Let everything be 
all right. The precarious ledge became solid ground, and 
John felt a weight lifted, his neck and shoulders relaxing 
from a cramped position he had not been aware of. The 
fatigue from so many months of misspent sleep caught up 
to him all at once. 

He looked at Theodore; he was clutching the rabbit's 
head so tightly that his knuckles had gone white. He slowly 
released the toy, propping it up on the pillow. 

“I’m not going,” he said. “Il was never really considering 
it, | just wanted Jessica to leave me alone.” He held his 
breath for a moment, then let out a deep sigh. “Right?” He 
said, his tone becoming more agitated. “What would | even 
say to these people?” Theodore stared at him blankly. 

“Damn.” John sighed.

The fluttering in John’s stomach grew worse the closer he 
came to Clay’s house. He checked the dashboard clock—it 
was only six. Maybe no one will be there yet, he thought, 
but as he made his way down the winding road toward their 
house, cars lined both sides of the street for half a block. 
John wedged his car between a pickup truck and a rusted 
sedan almost as beat-up as his own, then got out and 
headed toward the house. 

All the windows of the three-story house were 
illuminated, standing out against the trees like a beacon. 
John hung back, staying out of the light. He could hear 


music from inside, and laughter; the sound of it made him 
balk. He forced himself to walk the rest of the way to the 
door, but stopped again when he reached it: Going inside 
felt like an enormous decision, something that would 
change everything. Then again, so did walking away. 

He raised his hand to ring the bell, then hesitated; before 
he could decide, the door swung open in front of him. John 
blinked at the sudden light and found himself face-to-face 
with Clay Burke, who looked as startled as he was. 

“John!” Clay reached out and gripped John with both 
arms, pulled him in and gave him a hug, then quickly 
pushed him back to where he started and firmly patted his 
shoulders. “Right, come in!” Clay stepped back to clear the 
way, and John followed him in, looking around the room 
cautiously. The last time he was here, the whole house had 
been a wreck, strewn with signs of a man falling to pieces. 
Now, the piles of laundry and evidence files were gone; the 
couches and the floor were clean, and Clay himself was 
beaming with a genuine smile. He caught John’s eye, and 
his grin faded. 

“A lot has changed.” He smiled as though reading John’s 
mind. 

“Is Betty—” John broke off too late. He shook his head. 
“Sorry, | didn’t mean to—” 

“No, she’s still gone,” Clay said evenly. “I wish she’d 
come back; maybe she will someday, but life goes on,” he 
added with a brief smile. John nodded, uncertain what to 
Say. 

“John!” Marla waved from the stairs, and immediately 
came bounding down with her usual eagerness, wrapping 
him in a hug before he could so much as Say hello. Jessica 
appeared, coming in from the kitchen. 


“Hey, John,” Jessica said more calmly, but with a glowing 
smile. 

“I’m so glad to see you again, it’s been a long time,” 
Marla said, releasing him at last. 

“Yeah,” he said. “Too long.” He tried to think of 
something else to say, and Marla and Jessica exchanged a 
glance. Jessica opened her mouth, about to speak, but was 
interrupted as Carlton ran excitedly down the staircase. 

“Carlton!” John called with his first genuine smile of the 
evening. Carlton raised his hand in an answering wave, and 
came to join the group. 

“Hey,” he said. 

“Hey,” John echoed as Carlton tousled John’s hair. 

“What, are you my granddad now?” John made a 
halfhearted effort to straighten his hair while searching the 
crowd with his eyes. 

“I’m surprised you came.” Marla slapped him across the 
shoulder. 

“I mean of course you were going to come!” Carlton 
corrected. “I just know you’ve been busy! Too many 
girlfriends, am | right?” 

“How’s New York?” John asked, fishing for something to 
talk about as he straightened his clothes. 

“Great! College, city—learning—friends. | was in a play 
about a horse. It’s great.” He bobbed his head in a rapid 
nod. “Marla’s in school, too.” 

“In Ohio,” Marla jumped in. “I’m premed.” 

“That’s great.” John grinned. 

“Yeah, it’s been a lot of hard work but it’s worth it,” she 
said cheerfully, and John began to relax, falling back into the 
familiar pattern of their friendships. Marla was still Marla; 
Carlton was still inscrutable. 


“Is Lamar around?” Carlton asked, looking from face to 
face. Marla shook her head. 

“I! called him when ... a few months ago,” she said. “He’s 
on track to graduate early.” 

“But he’s not coming?” Carlton persisted. Marla smiled 
Slightly. 

“He said, ‘I’m never, ever, ever setting foot in that town 
again, not ever, never for as long as | live, and you 
shouldn’t, either.’ But he said we’re all welcome to visit 
him.” 

“In New Jersey?” Carlton made a skeptical face, then 
turned his attention to Jessica. “Jessica, what’s up with you 
these days, anyway? | heard you've got the dorm room to 
yourself now.” 

John stiffened, suddenly aware of what Carlton was really 
asking; the lights seemed blinding, the noise louder. Jessica 
glanced at John, but he didn’t acknowledge her. 

“Yeah,” she said, turning back to the others. “I don’t 
know what happened, but | came home one day right after 
... about six months ago, and, she was packing what she 
could carry. She left me and John to clean up the rest. If we 
hadn’t happened to walk in, | don’t think she was even 
going to tell me she was leaving.” 

“Did she say where she was going?” Marla asked, her 
brow furrowing. Jessica shook her head. 

“She hugged me and said she’d miss me, but all she’d 
say was She had to leave. She wouldn’t tell me where.” 

“Well, we can always ask her,” Carlton said. John looked 
at him, startled. 

“You've seen her?” 

Carlton shook his head. “Not yet, my plane just got in 
today, but she’ll be here tonight. Jessica says she looks 


good.” 

“Right,” John said. They all looked at him as if they could 
see what he was thinking: She looks good, but she doesn’t 
look like Charlie. 

“John, come help me in the kitchen!” Clay called, and 
John broke away from the group relieved, but also fully 
aware he couldn’t possibly provide any help in the kitchen. 

“What's up?” he asked. Clay leaned back against the sink 
and looked him up and down. “Need me to open the 
ketchup bottle?” John asked, growing nervous. “High shelf?” 

Clay sighed. “I just want to make sure you’re all right out 
there.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“| thought you might be nervous; | Know it’s been a while 
since you and Charlie talked.” 

“It’s been a while since you and | have talked, too,” John 
said, unable to keep the edge out of his voice. 

“Well, that’s different, and you know it,” Clay said drily. “1 
thought you might need a pep talk.” 

“A pep talk?” John retorted. 

Clay shrugged. “Well, do you?” Clay stared at him firmly, 
but with kindness in his eyes, and John’s nerves calmed. 

“Jessica told you?” he asked, and Clay tilted his head to 
the side. 

“Some. Probably not all. Here.” Clay opened the 
refrigerator door he had been leaning against and handed 
John a soda. “Try to relax, you’re here with friends. Those 
people out there love you.” Clay smiled. 

“| know,” John said, setting the can on the countertop 
next to him. He eyed it for a second but did not pick it up, 
feeling like if he drank it, he would be giving in, accepting 


everything he was told. It would be like taking whatever pill 
everyone else had already swallowed. 

John eyed the back door. 

“Don’t even think about it,” Clay said abruptly. John 
didn’t try to pretend it wasn’t what he was thinking. Clay 
sighed. “I know how hard this must be for you.” 

“Do you?” John responded sharply, but Clay’s expression 
didn’t change. 

“Stay and talk to her. | think you owe that to her, and to 
yourself.” 

John’s eyes were still fixed on the door. 

“All of this heartache that you’re putting yourself 
through; that can’t be what you want.” Clay leaned to the 
side, interrupting John’s gaze. 

“You're right,” John said. He stood up straight and met 
Clay’s eyes. “This isn’t what | want.” He went to the back 
door and pushed it open, rushing down the concrete steps 
as though Clay might pursue him, then walking around the 
side of the house toward his car, his heart pounding. He felt 
a little light-headed, and completely unsure he was making 
the right decision. 

“John!” someone called from behind him. The familiar 
voice sent a jolt through him, and he stopped, closing his 
eyes for a second. 

He heard her heels tapping on the stone walk, the sound 
vanishing as she crossed the grass to him. He opened his 
eyes and turned toward the voice; she was standing a few 
feet from him. 

“Thanks for stopping,” Charlie said. Her face was 
anxious, her arms wrapped tightly across her body like she 
was cold, despite the mild weather. 


“| was just going to get my jacket,” John said, trying to 
sound casual in the midst of an obvious lie. He looked her 
up and down, and she didn’t move, like she knew what he 
was doing, and why. /t’s not her. She looked like some 
stunning cousin of Charlie’s, maybe, but not her. Not the 
round-faced, frizzy-haired, awkward girl he had known 
almost all his life. She was taller, thinner, her hair longer, 
darker. Her face was uncannily different, though he could 
not have explained how. Her posture, even as she stood 
hugging herself in anxiety, was somehow elegant. As he 
looked at her, the first shock of recognition gave way to an 
acute revulsion; he took an involuntary step back. How can 
anyone think that’s her? he thought. How can anyone think 
that’s my Charlie? 

She bit her lip. “John, say something,” she said, pleading 
in her voice. He shrugged, holding both hands up in 
resignation. 

“I! don’t know what to say,” he admitted. 

She nodded. She uncrossed her arms as if she had just 
realized she was holding them that way, and began to pick 
at her nails instead. “I’m so happy to see you,” she said, 
sounding like she was about to cry. John softened, but 
tamped the feeling down. 

“Me too,” he said in a monotone. 

“I missed you,” she began, searching his face for 
something. John had no idea what he might look like, but he 
felt like stone. “I, uh, | had to get away for a while,” she 
went on uncertainly. “That night, John, | thought | was going 
to die.” 

“| thought you did,” he said, trying to swallow the lump 
rising in his throat. 

She hesitated. 


“You don’t think I’m me?” she asked softly at last. 

He looked down at his feet for a moment, unable to say 
the words to her face. 

“Jessica told me. It’s okay, John,” she said. “I just want 
you to know that it’s okay.” Her eyes were bright with tears. 
His heart lurched, and in an instant, the world came into a 
different focus. 

He gazed at the woman huddled in front of him trying to 
Suppress her sobs. The stark differences he saw in her were 
suddenly things that seemed so easily explained. Her shoes 
had heels, so she was taller. She was wearing a form-fitting 
dress, instead of her usual jeans and T-shirt, so she 
appeared thinner. She was wearing elegant clothing, and 
her gestures were confident, sophisticated, but it was all no 
more than if Jessica had given her the makeover she was 
always threatening. No more than if Charlie had just grown 
up. 

We've all had to grow up. 

John thought of the way he drove home from work—or, 
had until this morning—the way he avoided ever driving 
past her house, or the site of Freddy Fazbear’s. Maybe 
Charlie had things she wanted to avoid. Maybe she just 
wanted to be different. 

Maybe she wanted to change, like you did. When you 
think of that moment, what it did to you—what must it have 
done to her? What kind of nightmares do you have, Charlie? 
He was seized by a sudden, visceral desire to ask her, and 
for the first time he allowed himself to meet her eyes. His 
stomach jolted as he did, his heart racing. Tentatively, she 
smiled at him, and he smiled back, unconsciously mirroring 
her, but something frigid twitched inside him. Those aren’t 
her eyes. 


John shifted his gaze, a calm coming over him; Charlie 
looked momentarily confused. “Charlie,” John said carefully. 
“Do you remember the last thing | said to you, before you— 
were trapped in the suit?” She held his gaze for a moment, 
then shook her head. 

“I’m sorry, John,” she said. “I don’t remember a lot about 
that night, whole pieces are just—missing. | remember 
being in the suit—l passed out, | think for hours.” 

“So, you don’t remember?” he repeated gravely. It 
seemed impossible that she could have forgotten. Maybe 
she didn’t hear me. 

“Were you hurt?” he asked brusquely. 

She nodded silently, her eyes filling again with tears, and 
she hugged herself; this time she didn’t look cold, she 
looked like she was in pain. Maybe she was. John took a step 
closer to her, wanting suddenly, desperately, to promise her 
that everything would be all right. But then her eyes met his 
again, and he stopped, stepped back. She extended a hand, 
but he didn’t take it, and again she crossed her arms over 
her body. 

“John, would you meet me tomorrow?” she asked 
steadily. 

“Why?” he said before he could stop himself, but she did 
not react. 

“| just want to talk. Give me a chance.” Her voice rose 
Shakily, and he nodded. 

“Sure. Yeah, I'll meet you tomorrow.” He paused. “That 
same place, okay?” he added carefully, waiting to see how 
she would reply. 

“The Italian place? Our first date?” she said easily and 
gave a gentle smile; her tears seemed to have stopped. 
“Around six?” 


John let out a deep breath. “Yeah.” He met her gaze 
again and did not look away, letting himself take rest in her 
eyes for the first time that night. She looked back at him, 
motionless, like she was afraid she might scare him away. 
John nodded, then turned and left without another word. He 
walked quickly back to his car, struggling to keep his pace 
even. He felt like he had done something wonderful, and 
also like he had made a horrible mistake. He felt strange, 
riding an adrenaline rush, and as he drove through the dark 
he pictured her face again. 

Those weren't her eyes. 


* OK OX 


Charlie watched him go, rooted to the spot as if it were the 
only place she’d ever stood. He doesn’t believe me. Jessica 
had not wanted to tell her about John’s strange yet adamant 
conviction, but his refusal to speak to her now, his 
unwillingness even to acknowledge her presence that day in 
the diner was too bizarre to be dismissed. How can he think 
I’m not me? 

The taillights of John’s car vanished around a bend. 
Charlie stared into the dark where he had been, not wanting 
to return to the bright, noisy house. Carlton would tell her a 
joke; Jessica and Marla would comfort her the way they had 
in the diner that day, when she had come to show them that 
somehow, impossibly, she had survived. The walk from her 
car—really Aunt Jen’s borrowed car—toward the diner had 
felt like miles that day, her stomach fluttering anxiously 
even though she knew, of course, that they would be happy 
to see her. How could they not be? Every step was stiff, 
uncertain; every time she moved it hurt, her body sore all 


over from the day before, though there were no marks on 
her to show it. Even breathing was strained and unfamiliar, 
and she had a persistent feeling that if she forgot to do it, 
she would stop, die of asphyxiation right there on the 
pavement, unless she was reminded, take a breath. She 
could see them through the window as she made her way to 
the front of the diner, her heart racing, and then they saw 
her and it was everything she had dared to hope: Marla and 
Jessica ran to the door, jostling over who would hug her first, 
crying at the sight of her living face. She let herself be 
wrapped in the warmth of their relief, but before they even 
let her go, she was looking for John. 

When she saw him, his back to the door, she almost 
called out his name, but something stopped her. He said 
something she could not hear, and she watched, 
incredulous, as he failed to come to her, clenching a spoon 
in his hand like a weapon. “John!” she called at last. But he 
did not turn around. Marla and Jessica ushered her out of 
the restaurant, making reassuring sounds that must have 
been words, and Charlie strained to see him through the 
window: he had not moved. How can he pretend I’m not 
here? 

A shock of pain hit her suddenly, yanking her back to the 
present, and Charlie hugged herself tightly, though it didn’t 
really help: it was everywhere, sharp and hot. She clenched 
her jaw, unwilling to make a sound. Sometimes it eased to 
an ache she could push to the back of her awareness; 
sometimes it vanished for days at a time, but always it 
came back. 

Were you hurt? John had asked, the first—the only—sign 
he’d given that he might still care, and she had been unable 
to reply. Yes, she could have said. Yes, | was and / still am. 


Sometimes | think I'll die of it, and what | feel now is just an 
echo of what it used to be. It feels like all my bones are 
broken; it feels like my guts are twisted and torn; it feels like 
my head has cracked open, and things are leaking out, and 
it happens again and again. She clenched her teeth, taking 
deliberate breaths, until it began slowly to recede. 

“Charlie? Are you okay?” Jessica said quietly, appearing 
beside her on the sidewalk outside Clay’s house. Charlie 
nodded. 

“| didn’t hear you come over,” she said hoarsely. 

“He doesn’t mean to hurt you. He’s just—” 

“Traumatized,” Charlie snapped. “I know.” Jessica sighed, 
and Charlie shook her head. “Sorry, | didn’t mean to be 
rude.” 

“| know,” Jessica said. Charlie sighed, closing her eyes. 
He’s not the one who died—and it did feel like dying. She 
could only remember that crucial night in fragments: her 
thoughts were all scraps and whispers, hazy and muddled, 
everything circling slowly around a central point: the single 
unmistakable snapping sound of the spring locks. Charlie 
Shivered, and felt Jessica’s hand touch her shoulder. She 
opened her eyes, looking helplessly at her friend. 

“Il think he just needs time,” Jessica said gently. 

“How much time can he need?” Charlie asked, and the 
words sounded like stone. 





lt’s ready.” A soft voice rang out in the dark. 

“T’ll tell you when it’s ready,” said the man slumped in 
the corner, studying a monitor intently. “Raise it a few more 
degrees,” he whispered. 

“You've said before that might be too much,” she said 
from the opposite corner, leaning over a table. The light 
shimmered off her contours as she carefully examined what 
lay before her. 

“Do it,” the slumped man said. The woman touched a 
dial, then recoiled suddenly. 

“What is it?” he demanded. He didn’t take his eyes off 
the monitor. “Raise it two more degrees,” he ordered, his 
voice rising. Fora moment, the room was silent. Finally, the 
man turned toward the table. “Is there a problem?” 

“| think it’s ...” The woman trailed off. 


“What?” 

“Moving,” she finished. 

“Of course it is. Of course, they are.” 

“It looks like it’s ... in pain?” she whispered. The man 
smiled. 

“Yes,” 

A bright light flashed on abruptly as a sudden noise 
resounded from the center of the room. Red, green, and 
blue lights flashed in sequence and a cheerful voice erupted 
from the speakers embedded in the walls, filling the room 
with song. 

Every light shone down on him: the sleek white-and- 
purple bear. His joints clicked with every pivot; his eyes 
jolted back and forth randomly. He stood about six feet high; 
his rosy cheeks like two balls of bright cotton candy, and he 
wielded a microphone with a head like a shimmering disco 
ball. 

“Shut that thing off!” the slouched man shouted, getting 
to his feet with obvious difficulty. He moved slowly toward 
the center of the room, leaning heavily on his cane. “Get 
back, I’ll do it myself!” he screamed as the woman retreated 
to the table in the corner. The man pried a white plastic 
plate off the chest of the singing bear, and reached inside 
the cavity, extending his arm all the way into the opening 
and pulling at whatever he could find. As he disconnected 
the wires inside, first the eyes stopped turning, then the 
eyelids stopped clapping shut, then the mouth stopped 
singing and the head stopped turning. Finally, with one last 
jostle, the eyelids clamped shut and the head dropped to 
the side lifelessly. The man stepped back, and the heavy 
plate of the bear’s chest cavity swung shut with a clang, as 
the animatronic bear filled with the sounds of servos and 


wheels, broken and disconnected, unable to move or 
function. Spurts of air burst from between the seams of his 
body casing as the air hoses misfired. 

The sound came to a stop, the echoes from it lingering 
fora moment before dying away. The man turned his 
attention back to the table and lurched to it. He looked 
down, studying the writhing figure that lay there fora 
moment. The table’s surface was glowing orange, and the 
hot metal hissed. He took a syringe from the woman’s hand 
and thrust it into the squirming thing forcefully. He drew the 
plunger up, holding the needle steady as the syringe filled 
with molten substance, then finally pulled away with a jolt. 
He staggered back toward the bear. 

“Now, let us put you to greater purpose,” he said to the 
glowing syringe. The man again pried open the heavy chest 
plate of the standing, broken bear, then carefully inserted 
the syringe he held directly into the chest cavity and began 
to press the plunger down. The cavity snapped shut, too 
heavy for the frail man to hold open, and he fell backward 
clutching his arm. The syringe clattered to the ground, still 
nearly full. The woman rushed to kneel by his side, feeling 
his arm for breaks. “I’m fine,” he grumbled, and glanced up 
at the still motionless bear. “It needs to be heated more.” 
The hissing sound continued as the figure turned on the 
table, pushing off plumes of steam as it rolled on the hot 
surface. 

“We can’t heat it more,” the woman said. “You'll destroy 
them.” 

The man looked up at her with a warm smile, then jerked 
his eyes back to the bear: he was now looking down at 
them, his eyes open wide and tracking their subtlest 
movements. “Their lives will now have a greater purpose,” 


the man said contentedly. “They will become more, just like 
you did.” He looked up at the woman kneeling over him, and 
she looked back, her glossy painted cheeks gleaming in the 
light.

John let himself into his apartment and locked the deadbolt 
behind him, sliding the chain into place for the first time 
since he moved in. He went to the window and fiddled with 
the blinds, then stopped, pushing back the impulse to close 
them and seal himself away completely from the outside 
world. On the other side of the glass, the parking lot was 
still and silent, cast in the eerie light of a single streetlamp 
and the blue neon sign of a nearby car dealership. There 
was an unfamiliar whirring sound coming from somewhere, 
and John watched the parking lot for a moment, not sure 
what he was expecting to see. The sound was gone soon 
after anyway, and he went into the bathroom to splash 
water on his face. When he came back into his bedroom, he 
froze: it was the sound again, this time louder—it was in the 
room with him. 

John held his breath, straining to listen. It was a quiet 
noise, the sound of something moving, but it was too 
regular, too mechanical to be a mouse. He flipped on the 
light: the noise continued, and he slowly turned, trying to 
hear where it was coming from, and found himself looking at 
Theodore. 

“Is that you?” he asked. He stepped closer and picked up 
the disembodied rabbit’s head. He held it to his ear, 
listening to the strange sound emanating from inside the 
stuffed creature. There was a sudden click, and the sound 


stopped. John waited, but the toy was silent. He put 
Theodore back down on the dresser and waited for a 
moment to see if the sound would begin again. 

“I’m not crazy.” John said to the rabbit. “And | won’t let 
you, or anyone else, convince me that | am.” He went to his 
bed, reaching under the mattress with a suspicious glance 
at the toy rabbit, suddenly feeling watched. He took out the 
notebook he had hidden there, and sat back on the bed, 
looking at its black-and-white cover. It was a plain 
composition notebook, the kind with a little place on the 
front for your name and class subject. John had left that 
blank, and now he traced the empty lines with his finger, 
not really wanting to open the book that had sat, 
untouched, beneath his mattress for nearly three months 
now. 

At last he sighed and opened to the first page. 

“I’m not crazy,” he spoke to the rabbit again. “I know 
what | saw.” 

Charlie. He filled up the first page with nothing but facts 
and statistics, of which he knew embarrassingly few, he 
realized. He’d known Charlie’s father, but not her mother. 
Her brother was still a mystery. He didn’t even know if she’d 
been born in New Harmony, or if there was some other town 
before Fredbear’s, the diner they had discovered that first 
time they all returned to Freddy’s. He had painstakingly 
written out their shared history: childhood in Hurricane, then 
the tragedy at Freddy’s, then her father’s suicide. She had 
moved in with her aunt Jen after that. As he wrote that 
down, John realized that he had never known where Charlie 
and Jen lived. Close enough to Hurricane that she had 
driven rather than flown there for the dedication of 
Michael’s memorial scholarship, nearly two years ago, but it 


seemed odd that she had never even mentioned the name 
of the town where she now—and then—lived. 

He flipped through the pages; they grew less and less 
sparse as he had continued, the details filling in more and 
more as he called them over and over to mind. He had 
scribbled whole scenes of memory: like the time he put gum 
in her hair, thinking it would be funny. Charlie had stared at 
him with an impish look on her face as their first-grade 
teacher cut it out of her hair with little blue-handled safety 
scissors. Charlie had managed to retrieve that clump of 
hairy gum from the trash when no one was looking, and 
took it outside with her during recess. As soon as they were 
out the door, Charlie grinned at John. “I want to give you 
your gum back,” she said, and the afternoon became a 
game of chase, as they careened around the schoolyard, 
Charlie determined to shove the hair-encrusted piece of 
chewing gum back into John’s mouth. She had not 
succeeded: They were caught, and both given time-out. 
John smiled as he read the scribbled version of the story. It 
had seemed important to start with their childhood, to 
ground himself in the Charlie-that-was, and the John-that- 
was, as well. Now he sighed, and flipped ahead. 

In the later pages, he had tried to capture everything 
about her: the way she moved, the way she spoke. It was 
hard; the more time passed the more the memories would 
be John’s memory of Charlie and not Charlie, and so he had 
written down as much as he could, as fast as he could, 
starting three days after that night. There was the way she 
walked, self-assured until she realized someone was looking 
at her; there were the non sequiturs she tended to toss out 
every time she got nervous around people, which was often. 
There was the way she sometimes seemed to sink into 


herself, as if there were another reality going on inside her 
head, and she had stepped momentarily outside this one 
and into somewhere he could never follow. He sighed. How 
do you check for that? He flipped the notebook over: he had 
started a different set of thoughts from the back. 

What happened to Charlie? 

If the woman at Carlton’s party, the woman who had 
appeared so suddenly at the diner, was not Charlie, then 
who was she? The most obvious answer, of course, would be 
her twin. Charlie had always referred to a boy, but Sammy 
could easily be short for Samantha, and the memory Charlie 
had confided in him, of Sammy being taken from the closet, 
was a kidnapping, not a murder. What if Charlie’s twin was 
still alive? What if she had been not only kidnapped by 
Springtrap, William Afton at the time, but raised by him? 
What if she had been shaped and molded by a psychopath 
for seventeen years, primed with all the knowledge 
Springtrap could glean from Charlie’s life, and now she had 
been sent to take Charlie’s place? But why? What would be 
the point of that? Afton’s fixation on Charlie was disturbing, 
but he didn’t seem capable of anything so elaborate—or of 
caring for a human child long enough to brainwash her. 

He had written out a dozen other possible theories, but 
when he read them over now, none really felt right: They 
either fell apart upon scrutiny, or, like the imagined 
Samantha, they made no real sense. And in all cases, he 
could not match them to the Charlie he had met earlier that 
night. Her sorrow and her bemusement had seemed so real; 
picturing her face now raised a dull ache in his chest. John 
closed the book, trying to imagine for a moment the 
situation reversed: Charlie, his Charlie, turning from him, 
insisting that he was not himself—that he, the real John, was 


dead. /’d fall apart. He would feel the way Charlie had 
looked tonight, pleading, hugging herself as if it was all she 
could do to hold herself in one piece. He lay back on the 
bed, holding the book to his chest, where it sat, heavier 
than its weight. He closed his eyes, clutching the book like a 
child’s toy, and as he drifted to sleep he heard the sound 
from Theodore’s head again: the whirring, and then the 
click. 


* OK OX 


The next day, John woke up late and filled with a rootless 
dread. He glanced at the clock, realized in a panic that he 
was late for work, and almost simultaneously recalled that 
there was no more work, a reality that would have 
consequences soon enough, but not today. All he had to do 
today was meet Charlie. The dread swelled again at the 
thought of it, and he sighed. 

Late that afternoon, as he dug through his dresser for a 
presentable shirt, someone knocked at the door. John 
glanced at Theodore. 

“Who?” John whispered. The rabbit didn’t answer. John 
went to the door; through the front window he saw Clay 
Burke standing outside staring at the door, apparently 
politely ignoring the fact that he could see right into John’s 
apartment if he wanted to. John sighed and slid the chain off 
the latch, then opened the door wide. 

“Clay, hey. Come in.” Clay hesitated on the threshold, 
glancing at the interior that was too sparse to be a mess. 
John shrugged. “Before you judge, remember that I’ve seen 
your place look worse than this,” he said, and Clay smiled. 

“Yes, you have,” he said at last, and came inside. 


The noise from Theodore’s head started again, but John 
chose to ignore it. 

“What is that?” Clay asked after a few seconds. John 
waited to answer, knowing the sound would stop soon, and 
after a moment it did, with the same click as before. 

“It’s the rabbit head.” John smiled. 

“Right, of course.” Clay looked toward the dresser, then 
back at John as though nothing was out of the ordinary. 
Considering what they’d been through in the past, it really 
wasn’t. “So, what can | do for you?” John asked before 
something stranger could happen. Clay rocked on his heels 
momentarily. 

“! wanted to see how you were doing,” he said lightly. 

“Really? Didn’t we have that talk yesterday?” John said 
drily. He stood again and grabbed a clean shirt from his 
dresser and went into the bathroom to change. 

“Yeah well, you Know, you can never be too sure,” Clay 
Said, raising his voice to be heard. John turned on the 
faucet. “John, what do you know about Charlie’s aunt Jen?” 

John turned the faucet off abruptly, jarred out of his 
petulant mood. “Clay, what did you say?” 

“l said what do you know about Charlie’s aunt?” 

John changed his shirt quickly and came back out into 
the bedroom. “Aunt Jen? | never met her.” Clay gave him a 
Sharp look. 

“You never saw her?” 

“I didn’t say that,” John said. “Why are you asking me 
this now?” Clay hesitated. 

“Charlie became very eager to see you again when | 
mentioned that you had seen Jen that night,” he said, 
seeming to choose his words with care. 


“Why would Charlie care if | saw Jen or not? For that 
matter, why do you?” John reached past Clay to grab a belt 
hanging off the foot of the bed, and began to slip it through 
the loops of his jeans. 

“It just made me realize that there is a lot we don’t know 
about that night,” Clay said. “I think your conversation with 
Charlie tonight can help fill in those gaps, if you ask the 
right questions.” 

“You want me to interrogate her?” John laughed without 
humor. Clay sighed, frustration leaking through his habitual 
calm. 

“That’s not what I’m asking, John. All I’m saying Is, if 
Charlie’s aunt was there that night, then I’d like to ask her a 
question or two.” John stared at Clay, who just looked back 
at him placidly, waiting. John grabbed a pair of socks and 
sat down on the bed. 

“Why are you suddenly coming to me, anyway?” he 
asked. “No one’s believed anything I’ve said so far.” 

“It’s what we found at the compound,” Clay answered, 
more easily than John had expected. He straightened. 

“The compound—you mean Charlie’s dad’s house?” Clay 
gave him a level look. 

“I think we both know it was more than just a house,” he 
said. John shrugged and said nothing, waiting for him to go 
on. “Some of the things we found in the wreckage were ... 
they didn’t mean much to anyone else, but what | saw— 
some of the things | saw down there were pretty scary, even 
though most of it was buried under concrete and metal.” 

““Scary’? Was that the conclusion of your entire team, or 
just you?” John said, not bothering to keep the sarcasm out 
of his voice. Clay didn’t seem to hear him, his eyes fixed on 


a point between them. “Clay?” John said, alarmed. “What 
did you find? What do you mean, ‘scary’?” 

Clay blinked. “I wouldn’t be sure how else to describe it,” 
he said. John shook his head. “I will say this,” Clay said 
harshly. “I’m not ready to close the book on the 
Dave/William Afton/whatever else he was calling himself—” 

“Springtrap,” John said quietly. 

“I’m not ready to close the book on that case,” Clay 
finished. 

“What does that mean? You think he’s still alive?” 

“T just think we can’t make any assumptions,” Clay said. 
John shrugged again. He was out of patience—out of 
interest, almost. He was sick of intrigue: Clay withholding 
information, trying to protect them—as if keeping secrets 
had kept any of them safe, ever. 

“What do you want me to ask her?” John said plainly. 
“Just get her to talk to you. It’s been wonderful having 
her here again, don’t misunderstand, but it seems like she’s 

holding something back. It’s like she’s—” 

“Not herself?” John said with an edge of mocking. 

“That’s not what | was going to say. But | think she might 
know something she hasn’t told us yet—maybe something 
that she hasn’t felt comfortable sharing.” 

“And she might feel comfortable sharing it with me?” 

“Maybe.” 

“That feels morally ambiguous,” John said wearily. From 
the dresser, the whirring noise started again. “See? 
Theodore agrees with me,” he said, gesturing toward the 
rabbit. 

“Does it always do that?” Clay reached for the rabbit’s 
head, but before he could touch it, Theodore’s jaw snapped 
open and the head jerked in place. John startled, and Clay 


took a quick step back; they both watched, transfixed, as 
the sound went on, though the head did not move again. 
The sound it was making became a distorted murmur, 
louder and softer, at times almost mimicking words, though 
John could not even begin to make them out. After a few 
minutes, the head fell silent again. 

“I’ve never seen it do that before,” John said. Clay was 
bent over the dresser, his nose almost touching Theodore’s, 
as if he could see inside. 

“| need to go soon,” John said shortly. “I don’t want to be 
late, right? For this new open and honest relationship that 
I’m starting with her.” He made brief, accusing eye contact 
with Clay and went briskly to the door. “Don’t you need to 
lock it?” Clay asked as John brushed past him. 

“It doesn’t matter.” 


It was still light out when John got to St. George, and when 
he looked at the dashboard clock, John saw that he was over 
an hour early. He parked in the restaurant lot anyway and 
got out, glad for the opportunity to walk around and burn 
some nervous energy. He had avoided St. George, the town 
where Charlie and Jessica had been in college—/essica 
probably still is in college, he thought with a pang of guilt. / 
should know basic stuff like this. 

He walked past a few storefronts, heading 
semiconsciously for the movie theater he had been to with 
Charlie the last time he was here. Maybe we can go seé a 
movie. After the dinner-and-interrogation. John stopped 
short on the sidewalk: The theater was gone. Instead, two 
gigantic clown faces grinned at him from the windows of a 


gleaming new restaurant. The faces were almost as large as 
the wide front door, painted on either side, and above them 
was a Sign, in red and yellow neon letters: CIRCUS BABY’S PIZZA. 
The neon lights were on, glowing uselessly in the daylight. 
John stood motionless, feeling like his sneakers had fused to 
the parking lot. A group of kids rushed past him on their way 
in, and a teenager bumped into John, breaking him out of 
his daze. 

“Just keep walking, John,” he muttered to himself, turning 
to move away, but he stopped again after only a few steps. 
“Just keep walking,” he repeated in a sterner tone, and 
turned to face the restaurant defiantly. He approached the 
front door and pushed it. It opened into an empty vestibule, 
a waiting area, where smaller versions of the clowns out 
front smiled crazily from the walls, and a second door read 
WELCOME! in painted cursive letters. There was a familiar 
Smell in the air: some particular combination of rubber, 
sweat, and cooking pizza. 

John opened the second door, and noise exploded. He 
blinked in the florescent lights, bewildered: Children were 
everywhere, screaming and laughing, and running across 
the floor, and the jingles and blips of arcade games sounded 
discordantly from around the room. There were play 
structures, something like a jungle gym to his left, and a 
large ball pit to his right, where two small girls were 
throwing brightly colored balls at a third girl, who was 
shouting something he could not make out. 

There were tables set up in the center of the room, where 
he noticed five or six adults talking to one another. 
Occasionally they’d look over their shoulders at the chaos 
surrounding them, at the stage in back of the room, its red 


curtain closed. A chill went down his spine, and he looked 
around again with a terrible déja vu at the playing children 
and complacent parents. 

He started toward the stage, twice stopping just in time 
to avoid tripping over a game of tag. The curtains were 
brand-new, the red velvet plush and gleaming in the light, 
and trimmed with golden ropes and tassels. John slowed his 
pace as he got closer, the pit of his stomach tensing with an 
old, familiar dread. The stage floor was about level with his 
waist, and he stopped beside it and glanced around, then 
carefully grasped the thick curtain and began to pull it back. 

“Excuse me, sir,” a man’s voice came from behind him, 
and John straightened like he’d touched a hot stove. 

“Sorry,” he said, turning to see a man wearing a yellow 
polo shirt and a tense expression. 

“Are you here with your children, sir?” he asked, raising 
his eyebrows. The shirt read cIRCUS BABY’S PIZZA, and he was 
wearing a name tag that read STEVE. 

“No, |...” John paused. “Yes. Several children. Birthday 
party, you know. Cousins, So many cousins, what can you 
do?” 

Steve was still looking at him with raised eyebrows. 

“| have to go meet someone ... somewhere else,” John 
said. Steve gestured to the door. 





No!” Jessica cried in dismay as she wrangled her keys from 
the pocket of her fashionably too-tight jeans. An apple 
tumbled out of the paper grocery bag she was struggling to 
balance on her hip and rolled away down the hallway. It 
came to rest on the welcome mat of her worst neighbor, a 
middle-aged man who seemed capable of detecting the 
tiniest noise, then promptly complaining about it. In fact, 
since she moved in to the apartment six months ago, 
leaving behind the dorm room she and Charlie had shared, 
he had come to her door three times to complain about her 
radio. Twice it had not even been on. Mostly, he just glared 
at her whenever they passed in the hall. Jessica didn’t really 
mind the hostility; it was a little like being back home in 
New York. She left the apple where it was. 


Having managed to get the door open, Jessica dropped 
the bags on the kitchen counter and looked around the 
room with a quiet satisfaction. The apartment wasn’t very 
fancy, but it was hers. When she first moved in, she had 
gone on a cleaning rampage, scouring out the baked-in dirt 
that must have been lining the baseboards since the 
building went up some fifty years ago. It had taken almost 
two weeks of nothing but scrubbing between classes and 
homework, and she went to bed every night with sore arms, 
as though she’d done nothing but weight training. But now 
the apartment was clean enough for Jessica—albeit just 
barely—which was no small bar to clear. 

She began taking things out of the grocery bags, lining 
everything up on the counter before putting each item 
away. “Peanut butter, bread, milk, bananas ...” she muttered 
to herself, then fell silent. 

Something is wrong. She looked around the room 
carefully, but there was no one there and everything 
seemed to be where she’d last left it. She returned to the 
grocery bags. 

As she closed the refrigerator door the hair at the back of 
her neck prickled. Jessica whirled around as though 
expecting to catch a burglar in the act, her heart jolting with 
adrenaline, but the room was still. Just to be sure, she went 
to check the door: it was locked, as expected. She stood in 
silence for a moment, listening to the distant sounds of her 
apartment complex—the hum of an air-conditioning unit 
outside, a leaf blower across the street—but nothing 
seemed out of the ordinary. She stepped carefully back to 
the counter and finished putting away the groceries, then 
headed to her bedroom. She turned the corner to the 


hallway and screamed: a figure stood in the dark, blocking 
the way. 

“Jessica?” said a familiar voice, and Jessica reached 
hastily for the light switch, tensed to run. The light flickered 
on slowly: it was Charlie. 

“Did | scare you?” Charlie said uncertainly. “Sorry. The 
door was unlocked—| should have waited outside,” she 
added, looking down at her shoes. “I just figured since we 
used to be roomies anyway ...” 

“Charlie, you scared me to death,” Jessica said ina 
mock-scolding tone. “What are you doing here?” 

“Il told you I’m having dinner with John?” Charlie said, 
and Jessica nodded. “Could | borrow something to wear? 
Maybe you could help me pick something out?” Charlie 
looked hesitant, like she was asking an immense favor, and 
Jessica gave her a puzzled frown. 

“Yeah, sure, of course.” Jessica tried to calm herself. “But, 
Charlie—it’s not like you need my help choosing an outfit 
these days.” Jessica gestured at Charlie’s clothing: she was 
wearing her habitual combat boots—or a more elegant 
version of them—but she had paired them with a medium- 
length black skirt and a dark red, scoop-necked blouse. 
Charlie shrugged and shifted her feet. 

“T just think—he might like me better if you help me pick 
an outfit, instead of me dressing myself, you know? John 
doesn’t seem to like my new look.” 

“Well, Charlie ...” Jessica stopped, choosing her words 
carefully. “It won’t do either of you any good to pretend 
nothing has changed,” she said firmly. “Wear what you have 
on, you look great.” 

“You think so?” Charlie said, looking doubtful. 


“Yeah,” Jessica said. She brushed past Charlie to go into 
her room, stepping cautiously past her, and Charlie 
followed, pausing in the doorway like a vampire waiting for 
an invitation. Jessica looked at Charlie and was suddenly set 
at ease, as if their friendship had never been interrupted. 
Jessica grinned. “So, | mean, are you nervous?” she asked, 
going to her dresser for her hairbrush, and Charlie came in 
and sat down on the bed. 

“| feel like | have to prove something to him, but I’m not 
sure what,” she said, tracing the flower design on Jessica’s 
bedspread. “You were right, by the way.” 

Jessica turned around, brushing her hair absently. “He 
wants to see you tonight. | think that’s a great start,” she 
offered. “Just let him spend some time with you. He’s been 
through a lot. Remember, from his perspective, he saw you 
die, right in front of his eyes.” 

Charlie laughed, a soft, forced sound, then was silent. 
“I’m just worried about him. And | can’t even help him, 
because”—she broke off—“Jessica, do you remember him 
telling me something important that night?” Something in 
her tone changed: it was subtle, just a hint of strain. Jessica 
kept her expression neutral, pretending not to notice. 

“Something important?” Jessica asked. 

“Something ... that | would remember. Should 
remember.” She kept her eyes on the bedspread, still 
tracing the pattern like she was trying to memorize it. 
Jessica hesitated. She could still see it all, as vivid as the 
present, though it gave her a sick feeling in the pit of her 
stomach. Charlie was trapped in the twisted, broken Freddy 
suit, with just her arm free; John was holding her hand— 
Jessica shuddered, that terrible, singular crunching sound 
echoing in her head. 


“Jessica?” Charlie asked, and Jessica nodded briskly. 

“Sorry.” She cleared her throat. “I don’t know, you and 
John were alone together for a few minutes. I’m not sure 
what he said. Why?” 

“| think it’s important to him that | remember,” Charlie 
said, back to tracing the bedspread. Jessica watched her for 
a moment, suddenly ill at ease in her own bedroom. As if 
sensing it, Charlie stood and met her eyes. 

“Thanks, Jessica,” she said. “Sorry again for breaking in. | 
mean, | didn’t break in, the door was unlocked—but you 
know what | mean.” 

“No problem, just ... announce yourself sooner next 
time?” Jessica smiled, feeling a rush of warmth for her 
friend. She hugged Charlie good-bye at the door. Charlie 
walked a few steps and picked the apple up off the ground, 
then handed it back to Jessica. 

“I think this belongs to you.” Charlie smiled, then turned 
to walk away. When she had closed the door, Jessica sighed. 
The anxiety that had risen while Charlie was in her room 
had not abated. She leaned back against the door, replaying 
what had just happened. Why would John want Charlie to 
remember the last thing he said to her? She tossed the 
apple a few inches into the air, then let it fall back into her 
hand. 

“He’s testing her,” Jessica said to the empty apartment. 


* OK OX 


Outside Jessica’s building, Charlie stopped in the parking lot, 
frustrated. What did he say that was so important? She 
walked across the baked pavement to her car. Charlie 
climbed into her car, slamming the door shut with more 


force than she needed to. She stared petulantly at the 
steering wheel. They’re lying to me, she thought. / feel like a 
little kid, with all the grown-ups keeping secrets from me. 
Deciding for me what I should and shouldn’t know. 

She glanced at her watch—the clock in the car was either 
an hour ahead or an hour behind, and she could never 
remember which. She had about twenty minutes before she 
had to meet John. “I can’t show up early,” she said plainly, 
“then he really won't believe it’s me.” Trying to shrug off her 
bad mood, Charlie put the car in gear and pulled out of the 
lot. 

When she got to the restaurant, she could see John 
through the window, seated at the same table they had sat 
at last time, all the way in the back. He was staring into 
Space, as if he were deep in thought, or completely zoned 
out. She followed the hostess to his table, and it was only 
when she was standing right beside him that he seemed to 
realize she was there. When he did, he stood hastily. Charlie 
started to move toward him, but he sat back down, and she 
quickly sidestepped and did the same. 

“Hi,” she said with an awkward smile. 

“Hi, Charlie,” he said quietly, then grinned suddenly. 
“You're dressed a lot nicer than last time we were here.” 

“It probably just seems that way because I’m not covered 
in dirt and blood this time,” Charlie said lightly. 

“Right.” He laughed, but there was a quick instant of 
appraisal in his eyes. That was a test. The thought sent 
something cold through the pit of her stomach. She had 
known it would happen, but knowing did not make it easier 
to have his eyes, usually so warm, look at her with 
calculation. 


“What was that movie we saw?” John asked, seeming to 
fumble at an answer. “Last time | visited, we went to that 
theater down the street, didn’t we? It’s on the tip of my 
tongue.” 

“Zombies vs. Zombies!” Charlie said. 

“Right, | knew it was about zombies,” John said 
thoughtfully. 

“So, what have you been doing since then?” Charlie 
asked, attempting to shift the topic. “Are you still doing 
construction work?” 

“Yeah,” John said, then cast his eyes down at the table. 
“Actually, maybe not. | just got fired.” 

“Oh,” Charlie said. “I’m sorry.” 

He nodded. “Yeah. | mean, it was my fault. | showed up 
late, and—there was some other stuff—but | really liked that 
job. Well ... it was a job at least.” 

“There have to be other building sites,” Charlie said. 
“Yeah, | guess.” He looked at her searchingly, and she 
looked back, trying not to shrink under scrutiny. Believe me, 
she pleaded silently. What will it take for you to believe me? 

“I’ve missed this,” she said instead. 

He nodded, his eyes softening for a moment. “Me too,” 
he said quietly, though she knew it was only half true. 

“You know | didn’t leave because of—it wasn’t because of 
you,” Charlie said. “I’m sorry if it seemed like it was; | just 
had to get away from everything and everyone. I—” 

“Are you folks ready to order?” the waitress asked 
brightly. John straightened his posture and cleared his 
throat. Charlie looked down at the menu, glad of the 
interruption, but the pictures of food looked strange, as if 
she had heard food described, but never seen any. “Miss?” 
The waitress was looking at her expectantly. 


“I'll have the same,” Charlie said quickly, and shut the 
menu. The young woman frowned confusedly. 

“Oh, uh, okay. | guess | should order then.” John laughed. 

“Anything will be fine.” Charlie sat patiently. “I’m sorry. I'll 
be right back.” She got up from the table hastily and headed 
for the bathroom, leaving John to take care of things. 

Walking into the bathroom, she was struck with a jarring 
sense of déja vu. /’ve been here before. Trapped in a box, | 
was trapped in a box—Charlie slammed the door shut and 
locked it. /’m not trapped. She ran her fingers through her 
hair, though it didn’t really need adjusting, and washed her 
hands; she was just killing time, stealing a moment away 
from John’s scrutiny. Every time he gave her that level, 
untrusting look, she felt exposed. 

“lam Charlie,” she said to her reflection, smoothing 
down her hair again nervously. “I don’t have to convince 
John that I’m me.” The words sounded thin in the small 
room. Who else would | be? Charlie washed her hands 
again, straightened her shoulders, and went back out into 
the dining room. She sat down and put her paper napkin in 
her lap, then looked John squarely in the eye. 

“| still don’t remember,” she said abruptly, seized by an 
obstinate recklessness. 

John raised his eyebrows. “What?” 

“| don’t remember what you said to me that night. | know 
it’s important to you—I know maybe it’s why you think what 
you think about me, but | just ... don’t remember. | can’t 
change that.” 

“Okay.” He slid his hands off the edge of the table and let 
them rest in his lap. “I know—I know that. Um, a lot 
happened that night. | know.” He sighed for a moment but 
then smiled almost reassuringly. Charlie bit her lip. 


“If it’s that important, why can’t you just tell me?” she 
asked gently. Instantly, she could see that it was the wrong 
thing to say. John’s features hardened; he drew back from 
the table slightly. She looked down at the napkin in her lap; 
she had been shredding the corner of it without noticing. 
“Never mind,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, 
letting several long minutes pass. “Forget | said anything.” 
She looked up, but John didn’t respond. 

“Excuse me for just a minute. I'll be right back.” He got 
up and left the table. 

She stared at his empty chair. The waitress approached 
and cleared her throat; Charlie heard her, but did not move. 
She wasn’t sure she could move. This is going horribly. 
Maybe I'll just sit here forever. I'll be a statue of myself, a 
monument to Charlie-that-was. Charlie-that-will-never-be- 
again. 

“Miss?” The waitress sounded concerned, and it was 
enough for Charlie to, with herculean effort, turn her head. 
“Is everything all right, miss?” the waitress asked, and it 
took Charlie another long moment to comprehend the 
question. 

“Yes,” she said at last. “Could | have another napkin?” 
She held up the first, half-shredded, as evidence of her 
need, and the waitress went away. Charlie turned back to 
John’s empty chair. 

John slid back into view and sat down, breaking the line 
of her vacant stare. 

“Everything okay?” he asked. She nodded. 

“The waitress is getting me another napkin.” Charlie 
gestured vaguely in the direction the waitress had gone. 

“Right.” He opened his mouth to go on, but before he 
could speak, the waitress returned, carrying Charlie’s 


napkin, along with their food. They were both silent as she 
placed it in front of them, and John smiled at her. “Thanks,” 
he said. Charlie stared at her plate: it was some kind of 
pasta. She took her fork carefully but didn’t start to eat. 

“Can | ask you something?” John finally said, and she 
nodded eagerly, setting the fork back down. He took a deep 
breath. 

“That night, how did you survive? I—There was so much 
blood ...” He stopped, at a loss for words. Charlie looked at 
him, at the familiar face that had somehow turned against 
her. She had been trying to piece together a story for him, 
but now she just spoke. 

“| don’t know,” she said. “I—There’s time missing, when | 
try to think about it my mind—flinches away, like it’s hit 
something sharp.” The distance in John’s eyes faded a little 
as she spoke. “I’d been in a suit before,” she went on. “| 
think | must have figured out how to get away somehow, or 
at least how to position myself.” She looked anxiously at 
him, and his gaze sharpened. 

“T still don’t understand. How did you manage to get 
away ... undamaged?” He looked her up and down again, 
seeming to examine her. 

Charlie’s breath caught in her throat, and she turned 
away from him, staring fixedly out the window at the 
parking lot. 

“I didn’t,” she said tightly. 


* *K X* 
John didn’t answer, searching Charlie’s half-turned face for a 


spark of something he could recognize—or not recognize. 
She was saying all the right things, in all the right ways, and 


her hints—more than hints—at the unshakable trauma she 
had gone through that night made his stomach clench. As 
she gazed off into the middle distance, her jaw was 
clenched; she looked like she was fighting something off, 
and John was seized with a sudden urge to go to her, to hold 
out his hand and offer his help. Instead he picked up his fork 
and began to eat, looking down at his plate instead of at 
her. She knows what I’m doing, he thought, chewing grimly. 
She’s giving me the right answers. Some detective I’ve 
turned out to be. John took another bite and stole a glance 
at her; she was still looking off at the parking lot. He 
swallowed and cleared his throat. 

Before he could speak, Charlie turned back to him. “After 
that night, | had to get away,” she said. Her voice was 
hoarse, and her face was strained, her features seeming 
harsher than before. “I had to leave everything behind, 
John. Everything. My whole life has been haunted by what 
happened here, and the last couple of years ... even before 
that, too. It’s just been my whole life.” She met his eyes 
briefly, then looked away, blinking rapidly like she was 
holding back tears. “I wanted be somebody different; | had 
to or I’d go insane. | know it’s a cliché to think you can 
change your life if you change your hair and your clothes” — 
she gave an ironic half smile and flipped her long hair over 
her shoulder—“but | couldn’t be your Charlie forever, that 
naive little girl, scared of her own shadow; /iving in a 
shadow. Honestly, | don’t even know what you saw in that 
girl—selfish, scatterbrained, pathetic.” She said the last 
word so caustically that she almost shook with it, a sour look 
coming over her face as if loathing for her past self had 
overwhelmed her. 


“| never thought you were any of those things,” John said 
quietly, and looked down. He ran his fork along the rim of 
his plate, not Knowing what to say. He made himself look up; 
Charlie’s face had softened, and now she seemed anxious. 

“But it’s still me.” She shrugged, her voice breaking. He 
couldn’t answer; he didn’t know where to start. Charlie bit 
her lip. “You still think it, don’t you?” she said after a 
moment. John shifted uncomfortably in his seat, ashamed, 
but Charlie pressed on. 

“John, please, | don’t understand. If you think I’m not me, 
then ... what do you think? Who can you possibly think | 
am?” She looked utterly bewildered, and again John felt 
himself wavering. 

“| think—” He gestured graspingly at the air, catching 
nothing. “Charlie, what | saw—!” he exclaimed, then 
stopped short, remembering they were in public. He glanced 
around, but no one was looking at them: the restaurant was 
not busy, but everyone there was occupied, the guests 
talking to the people they came with, the staff talking 
among themselves. “I saw you die,” he said, lowering his 
voice. “When you walked into that diner the next day, 
Charlie, | wanted to believe it was true—! sti// want to 
believe it, but I—I saw you die,” he finished helplessly. 
Charlie shook her head slowly. 

“I’m telling you that I’m alive, how can that not be 
enough? If you want to believe me, why don’t you?” The 
pain in her voice sent a pang of guilt through him, but he 
met her eyes calmly. 

“Because I'd rather know the truth than believe 
something just because it would make me happy.” 

Charlie looked at him searchingly. “So, what do you think 
is the truth? Who do you—” she swallowed, and started 


again. “Who do you think | am, if I’m not me?” 

John sighed. “I’ve thought about it a lot,” he said at last. 
“Almost constantly, actually.” Charlie nodded slightly, barely 
moving her head, like she was afraid she would spook him. 
“| thought about a lot of things, | guess—theories—um ...” 

“Like what?” Charlie asked gently. 


“Well...” John’s face was getting hot. / should never have 
agreed to see her. 
“John?” 


“I—I guess maybe | thought you might be Sammy,” he 
mumbled; she looked puzzled for a moment, like she had 
not quite heard him, then her eyes widened. 

“Sammy’s dead,” she said tightly. John looked up at the 
ceiling and put his hands to his temples. 

“| know,” he said, and met her eyes again. “But, Charlie, 
look: | don’t know that. Neither do you. The last thing ... you 
remember, of Sammy, what was it?” 

“You know the answer to that,” she said in a low, level 
voice. 

“You saw him being taken,” John said after a moment. 
She made no response, and he took it as license to 
continue. “You saw him being kidnapped, not killed. By 
Dave, or Afton—Springtrap. So, what if he wasn’t killed? 
What if Sammy was raised by William Afton, twisted, and 
brought up by a murderous madman to replace you—to 
replace Charlie—after her death? Also, Sammy could be 
short for Samantha. | forgot that part. Sammy could have 
been a girl all along.” Charlie was motionless across the 
table; she scarcely looked like she was breathing. “I Know 
how it sounds when | say it out loud,” John added in a rush. 
“That’s why | mostly don’t.” Charlie had covered her face 
with her hand, and her shoulders were shaking. He broke off 


as she looked up: this time she was laughing. There was a 
manic edge to it, like it might turn back into crying at any 
moment, but John tentatively tried to smile. 

“Oh, John,” she said at last. “I don’t even—You know 
that’s crazy, right?” 

“Is it crazier than anything else we’ve seen?” he argued 
without much conviction. 

“John, you took me to see the grave yourself, 
remember?” 

John paused and looked confused for a moment, trying to 
reconcile what he’d just heard. 

“You took me yourself, to Sammy’s grave.” 

“Il took you to the cemetery, but | never saw Sammy’s 
grave, or your father’s,” John corrected. 

“Then go look sometime.” Charlie’s voice was patient. 
John felt immediately foolish. 

“Aunt Jen warned me not to come back to Hurricane.” 
Charlie looked down at the table. “She’s three for three at 
this point. Have you heard from her, by the way?” 

“From your aunt?” John asked, disconcerted by the 
sudden change of subject. “I figured you were living with 
her after you moved out of Jessica’s place.” 

“Yeah,” Charlie said. 

“You were living with her?” 

“Have you seen her?” 

“Why would | have seen her?” John asked slowly, 
suddenly feeling a bit lost in the conversation. He had seen 
Jen twice: once as a child, and once on that terrible night, 
crouched beside the twisted, broken Freddy suit in a pool of 
Charlie’s blood. But Charlie didn’t know about either. “You 
know I’ve never actually met her,” John said, watching 


Charlie’s face. Her expression was pensive, and did not 
change. 

“| just thought she might try to get in touch,” Charlie said 
idly. 

“Okay. I'll let you know if she does?” John offered. 
“Please do, thanks,” Charlie said. It was only then that 
she seemed to register his confusion. “I haven’t seen her in 
a while. She rescued me that night,” she said. “She took me 

home and cleaned me up, made Sure | was okay.” She 
flashed John a quick half smile, and he returned it warily. 

“| thought you said you didn’t remember anything from 
that night,” he said, trying to keep his tone from sounding 
accusatory. 

“| said there was a lot | don’t remember. But mostly 
that’s what Jen told me. Honestly, the first thing | remember 
is her waking me up the next morning, telling me to put on 
the dress she had for me.” Charlie made a face. “She always 
wanted me to dress more like a girl. Of course, the joke was 
on me; it turns out after a few near-death experiences, 
there’s nothing | wanted more than a makeover.” 

John smiled, and she batted her eyelashes 
exaggeratedly. He laughed in spite of himself. 

“So, you think she might be looking for you?” He paused, 
unsure how to phrase the next part. “Do you want her to 
find you?” he asked at last, and she shrugged. 

“I'd like to know where she is.” 

“She’s not at the house where you’re living? When did 
she leave?” 

“Everybody leaves eventually,” Charlie said in a sardonic 
tone, and he laughed again, less heartily. 

You didn’t answer my question. 


Charlie glanced at her watch: like everything else she 
now wore, it was a smaller, feminized version of the one she 
used to have. “There’s a good zombie movie starting in 
about fifteen minutes, | think,” she said brightly. “The new 
theater isn’t far from here. What do you think, should we 
see if the old formula still works?” 

What does that mean? John held back a smile. “I can’t go 
to the movies,” he said with real reluctance. “I’ve got 
somewhere that | need to be.” 

“Another time?” Charlie said, and he nodded. 

“Yeah, maybe.” 

As he walked back to his car, John noticed a crowd 
outside the new pizzeria. / guess everybody likes the circus, 
he thought. He wandered closer, trying to see where Charlie 
had gone, but she was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, like 
noticing hidden figures in a picture, John realized that the 
crowd around him was dotted with clowns: painted faces, 
white billowy costumes, noses of all shapes and colors. They 
were everywhere. He backed out of the throng, tripping on 
an oversize shoe and almost falling off the sidewalk. 

When he was free of the crowd, John took a deep breath 
and looked back at the restaurant, noticing for the first time 
the banner strung over the front entrance. GRAND OPENING: 
COME DRESSED AS A CLOWN AND EAT FREE! it read, hanging between 
the gigantic faces of two grinning clowns. He looked around. 
More people were arriving, many of them in costume, and 
John felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. He 
glanced behind him, but there was nothing sinister, besides 
the clowns. He forced himself to look at them individually: 
people had dressed with varying degrees of enthusiasm— 
some had structured bodysuits, wigs, and enormous feet; 


others had simply painted their faces and worn polka-dot T- 
Shirts. Still, his sense of unease did not abate. 

They’re just people in costumes, he scolded himself, then 
laughed abruptly, startling a woman standing nearby. 
“People in costumes. That’s never gone wrong for me,” he 
muttered, walking away from the crowd to find his car. 


* OK OX 


Driving home, John found himself agitated; twice he looked 
at the speedometer and saw that he’d gone dangerously 
over the speed limit without noticing. He tapped his hand 
restlessly against the steering wheel, thinking of the next 
day. What then? Seeing Charlie had rattled him more than 
he had realized. After months of solitary scribbling, going 
over and over his bizarre theories, he’d been forced to put 
his conviction to the test, to ask her questions and watch 
her answer, and ask himself as he did, Are you her? Are you 
my Charlie? Now that it was over, it felt unreal, like a dream 
that lingered too long, unwelcome in the waking world. As 
he approached the turnoff that would take him home, he 
sped up, driving straight on past it. 

John parked his car a few blocks away from Clay Burke’s 
house. He pulled the keys out of the ignition and jangled 
them nervously in his hand for a minute, then opened the 
door decisively and got out. When he got to the house it 
was dark except for a single window, which he thought was 
Clay’s office. / wonder if Carlton’s gone back to school, he 
wondered, unsure whether he was hoping for his friend’s 
presence, or his absence. 

He knocked and waited, then rang the bell. A long 
moment later, Clay opened the door. 


“John. Good,” he said, and nodded, seeming unsurprised 
by his presence. He stepped aside to let John in, and 
ushered him into the study. “Do you want some coffee?” he 
asked, gesturing at the mug on his desk. 

“It’s a little late for me,” John said. “I'll be up all night.” 

Clay nodded. “I’m substituting lesser vices,” was all he 
said. John glanced around the room. The last time he had 
been here they’d used the desk as a barricade against an 
army of angry animatronics. 

“You fixed the door,” he observed. 

“| fixed the door,” Clay said. “Oak. Reinforced. What 
brings you here?” 

“| saw Charlie.” Clay raised his eyebrows, but didn’t say 
anything. “She said something: she asked if I’d heard from 
—" John stopped, seized by a sudden sense that he was 
being watched. Clay had his head tilted to the side as 
though sensing something as well. 

Silently, Clay made his way to the closed window, 
positioning himself beside one of the long, pale green 
drapes, and peered outside. “Everyone is a little on edge 
with all these weirdos walking around in face paint,” he said, 
but he kept his voice low. He pulled the drapes together, 
then walked back toward John. “Have a seat,” Clay offered; 
there were two dark green upholstered chairs and a 
matching couch along one wall. John sat on the couch. Clay 
grabbed his desk chair and dragged it across the rug so 
they were only a few feet apart. 

“What did Charlie ask you?” Clay began. John glanced at 
the window again; he felt as if waves of dread were 
emanating from it, rolling into the room like an unseen fog. 
Clay looked back over his shoulder, but only for a second. 
John cleared his throat. 


“She asked about her aunt Jen. If I'd seen her. | thought 
you might know something?” he finished uncertainly. Clay 
looked lost in thought, and John wondered for a moment if 
he should repeat himself. 

“No,” Clay said finally. “Did Charlie say why she was 
asking?” 

John shook his head. “She just said she wanted to know if 
I'd heard from her. | don’t know why | would hear from her, 
though,” he said. He was choosing his words carefully, as if 
saying the right ones in the right order would unlock a door 
in Clay’s mind, and convince him to tell John what he knew. 
Clay just nodded thoughtfully. “Did you ever meet her?” 
John asked. 

“Never a formal introduction, no,” Clay said. “She was a 
bit older than Henry, | think.” Clay got quiet for a moment 
and tilted his glass from side to side, swirling the last few 
sips at the bottom. “When he moved here, Henry was 
something of a recluse; we all knew he’d lost a kid.” Clay sat 
up slowly. “Didn’t see them for a while, even Charlie, and 
then ...” Clay let out a pained sigh. “Jen was around for 
about a year, and she was the one watching the kid. Jen 
stuck to Charlie’s side like glue. | guess Henry just didn’t 
trust people anymore, and | can’t blame him.” 

“| always kind of got the impression ...” John paused, 
choosing his words again. “Charlie always gave me the 
impression that she was kind of cold.” 

“Well, like | said, after something like that,” Clay said. “1 
was surprised when Jen took Charlie, after Henry died,” he 
went on. 

“What about Charlie’s mother?” John asked hesitantly. It 
felt intrusive to pry, worse because Charlie was not here: he 
felt like they were talking about her behind her back. 


“No, Charlie’s mother ran off before her and her father 
moved to Hurricane,” Clay said. “Henry never said anything 
bad about her mother. He pretty much never said anything 
about her at all, but | asked one day, just out of curiosity. 
Maybe it was the detective in me; | couldn’t help myself. He 
thought a long time before answering me, then he gave me 
this sad look, and he said, ‘She wouldn’t know what to do 
with my little girl.’ | backed off the subject after that. | 
mean, | knew they’d lost another kid. | guess | assumed 
Charlie’s mother had had some kind of breakdown, or else 
just found herself unable to care for a child so much like the 
one she’d lost. | think it should be said, though, to her aunt 
Jen’s credit, Charlie seems to have turned out all right.” He 
smiled and gave a nod. “She’s a bit odd, but she’s a good 
kid.” 

“She’s unique, for sure,” John said. 

“Unique, then,” Clay said drily. The walls trembled briefly 
as a strong wind passed over the house. John cast his eyes 
around the room uncomfortably, then lit on something 
familiar in the corner, tucked away between the end of a 
bookshelf and the wall. 

“Is that Ella?” John asked, pointing. Clay looked blank for 
a moment. 

“The doll? That turned up in the rubble of Charlie’s old 
house. The rest got hauled away, but | kept that.” 

“Her name is Ella,” John said. “Charlie’s dad made her, 
she used to go around on a track, carrying a tea set.” 

“l asked Charlie if she wanted it,” Clay said. “She wasn’t 
interested.” 

“She wasn’t?” John repeated, alarmed. Clay shook his 
head absently. 


“| have a hard time believing that,” John said 
incredulously as he held the old toy in his arms, and Clay 
came back to attention. 

“Well, tell her that it’s here if she ever wants it.” 

“| will,” John said, setting the doll back down. Clay 
glanced at the window again and looked preoccupied. “Is 
something wrong?” John asked. 

“Not at all,” he said. 

John raised his eyebrows. “Are you sure about that?” 

Clay sighed. “A child was abducted this morning.” 

“What?” 

“A little girl, she disappeared sometime between mid- 
night and six a.m.” Clay was stone-faced; John searched for 
words and came up empty. “It’s the second one this month, 
Clay added quietly. 

“| haven't heard anything about that,” John said. He 
glanced at the window again as the wind began to howl 
outside, then looked back at Clay, and immediately the knot 
of fear took up its post behind his head again. “Do you have 
any leads?” John asked the first question he could think of. 
Clay didn’t answer for a long moment, and John asked the 
next question. “Do you think it has something to do with—I 
mean, missing kids, it’s not the first time that’s happened 
here.” 

“No, it’s certainly not.” Clay was staring into the space 
between them as if there was something there he could see. 
“| don’t see any way that it could be connected, though; 
Freddy’s has been destroyed at this point.” 

“Right,” John said. “So, you don’t have any leads?” 

“I’m doing the best that | can.” Clay lowered his head 
and ran his hand though his hair, then sat up straight again. 
“I’m sorry. It’s got me on edge; | feel like I’m reliving those 


” 


days: children, the same age as my little boy—the same age 
as you back when—getting snatched one after another, and 
there was nothing | could do to stop it then, either.” 

“Michael,” John said quietly. 

“Michael. And the others. There never seems to be a 
Shortage of evil in this world.” 

“But that’s why we have you, right?” John smiled. 

Clay snorted. “Right. | wish it were that simple.” 

“You said two kids were missing?” John said, his eyes 
drawn again toward the sound of the wind dragging 
branches and leaves against the side of the house. 

Clay stood up and went to the window, almost defiantly, 
and opened it wide. John startled at the sound of the 
window cracking. John could see from where he sat that 
Clay seemed to be scanning the area for something under 
the guise of getting some air. 

After a moment, he pulled himself back inside and shut 
the window, then drew the curtains closed. “It might not be 
as bad as it looks now, John. There’s usually a normal 
explanation, and most kids turn up, one way or another. Two 
weeks ago, there was a little boy named Edgar, whatever. 
Two and a half years old.” 

“What happened?” 

“His parents have been fighting about custody for over a 
year. His father ends up losing that fight—only gets to see 
the kid once a month, supervised visits, which | can tell you 
was for good reasons. Edgar disappears, surprise, Surprise. 
He was found a few days later, alive and well; soontaneous 
road trip with his dad. Most kidnappings, it’s one of the 
parents.” 

“Is that what you think is happening here?” John asked 
Sskeptically. 


“No.” Clay didn’t take long to answer. “No, | don’t,” he 
repeated, sounding graver. 

He took a deep breath and leaned forward. “And it 
doesn’t help that the whole town’s obsessed with this new 
restaurant, dressing up like clowns—it’s a waste of time for 
my officers to be doing crowd control, or clown control, as it 
were.” 

“Can | do anything?” John asked, though he couldn’t 
imagine what kind of help he could be. 

“Not a thing,” Clay said. “If I’m right, | may need you. 
And I'll need—” He stopped. 

“Charlie,” John said. “You'll need Charlie.” 

Clay nodded. “It’s not fair to ask that of her,” Clay said. 
“Not after everything she’s been through. But | will if | have 
tO." 

“Yeah,” John said. Clay was staring at the space between 
them again, and John felt suddenly like he was intruding. 
“It’s getting late,” he said. 

“Yeah, well, watch yourself out there,” Clay said, hastily 
standing. “Do you want to take my gun?” Clay said lightly. 
He smiled, but there was tension in his face, as though he 
were half hoping John would take it. 

“Don’t need it.” John grinned. “I’ve got these guns.” He 
held a tight fist in the air and threatened the room before 
letting himself out. 

“Okay, tough guy, see you soon,” Clay said grimly. 


* OK OX 
John started back toward his car: it was pitch-black now—it 


had been dark when he arrived, he realized, but now he 
noticed it. The streetlamps didn’t go far, the pools of light 


beneath him swallowed up only a few feet out. His footsteps 
landed hard; and there seemed to be no way to quiet them. 
The distant roar of the highway was too faint to provide 
cover, and the wind was silent for the time being, as though 
it had temporarily gone into hiding. Something moved a few 
yards ahead of him, and John stopped dead: coming down 
the road was another costumed moviegoer, but there was 
something off about this one. It was heading in his direction, 
walking in the middle of the road at an even pace. John 
stayed where he was between two of the tall, thin saplings 
planted along the sidewalk, his eyes glued to the 
approaching figure. 

As it came closer, a chill gripped John’s spine: The 
clown’s movements were feminine, but wrong. She walked 
like something mechanical, yet graceful. His breath caught 
in his throat as the clown glided toward him like a wraith. 
The creature was Staring straight ahead as it passed; John 
waited, hoping to stay out of its line of sight. As she grew 
closer however, her eyes drifted toward him, her head 
turning only slightly as though to acknowledge his passing. 

John stared back, at first admiring the sleek and 
controlled beauty of her face, split down the middle through 
some trick of costuming. John instinctively took a step back 
—he had seen monsters before—and prepared to run, or 
fight, if necessary. But just as his heart began thudding 
against his chest, she looked away again and slipped back 
into the dark as gracefully as she had appeared. John 
watched for a moment, then continued to his car. He 
checked his rearview mirror, but there was no one in sight. 
As he drove home, he checked the mirror more often than 
he needed to. His thoughts kept returning to those shiny, 
penetrating eyes: the clown had looked at him like she knew 


him; like she could see right through him. “Relax,” John said 
to the empty car. “It was just some weirdo in a costume.” 
Saying the words aloud, however, did not make them any 
more convincing. 


* OK OX 


Clay went back to his office and stopped by the window, 
drawing aside the curtains slightly to make sure John had 
made it around the corner and out of sight. Clay sighed; he 
sat down at his desk, picked up the case file on the second 
missing child, and began to review it. The information he 
needed just wasn’t there, but it didn’t stop him from 
returning to it over and over again. His officers had 
diligently done their jobs: they’d gone to the right places, 
talked to the right people, and asked all the wrong 
questions. They just don’t know what | know. 

There was a sound from down the hallway, a distinct 
creak. Clay’s eyes lifted, and he set the file carefully back on 
his desk. 

“John?” he called, but there was no response. With 
practiced calm, Clay quietly reached for the gun he kept ina 
holster under his desk and flipped the safety off. He went to 
the open office door and paused, listening for another noise 
from the dark hall. Nothing came. Clay pulled the door shut, 
Snapping the deadbolts into place. 

Clay stepped back into the center of the room and stood, 
listening. A moment passed in silence and his eyes dropped, 
his shoulders feeling at ease, but suddenly his eyes lifted 
again, and his jaw clenched. He took one deliberate step 
back, focusing directly on the center of the door ahead of 
him. He lifted and steadied his gun, and took aim. Several 


minutes passed, but Clay’s eyes never wavered. There was 
something in the hall. 


* OK OX 


John let his front door fall shut behind him with a heavy thud 
and tossed his keys on the kitchen counter. He sat down 
heavily on the couch, letting his head fall back, weighted 
down with fatigue. After only a moment, he lifted his head 
back up: the strange noise was coming from his bedroom 
again. It sounded a little like the sounds the rabbit’s head 
had been making, but something had changed, though he 
couldn’t pinpoint how. It sounded like a voice, then static, a 
voice, then static. Something was being repeated. 

John’s bedroom door was almost all the way closed, and 
he got up from the couch and approached it slowly from the 
side, putting his feet down silently one after the other, the 
rubber soles scarcely tapping the floor. He eased the door 
open: the sound was louder now, more distinct: the voice 
continued, garbled and muffled. John turned on the light and 
went to Theodore’s head. He bent over so his eyes were 
level with Theodore’s plastic ones, and listened. The rabbit’s 
head stared back, muttered words, broke into static, then a 
moment later repeated. John grabbed a notebook and pen 
off his bed and closed his eyes, concentrated on the sounds. 

After a minute, he began to hear words. “Shining?” John 
whispered. “Shining—something. Silver?” He continued to 
listen, but he couldn’t make out the rest. John gritted his 
teeth and opened his eyes, glaring at the stuffed rabbit's 
head as it continued to repeat the same incoherent phrase. 
John drew in a long breath, then let it out, trying to release 
the tension in his neck, in his jaw, in his back. He sat down 


on the bed, put the pen and paper down, and closed his 
eyes once more. Just listen. The sounds repeated, again and 
again. Suddenly, they resolved, like song lyrics after the 
thousandth play: John understood. 

“Shining Star? Silver ... something. Silver Reef? Shining 
Star, Silver Reef.” 

“Shining Star, Silver Reef,” Theodore repeated. John got 
up again, putting his ear to Theodore’s nose, trying to make 
sure he had it right. “Shining Star, Silver Reef ...” the rabbit 
intoned. John raced back to his car. 

When he reached Clay’s driveway again, John stopped 
dead: the front door was gaping open, light from inside the 
house spilling into the yard. He ran up the steps, calling, 
“Clay! Clay, are you here?” He ran inside, still shouting, and 
made for Clay’s office just a few steps past the front hall. 

“Clay!” 

John dropped to his knees beside Clay; he was on the 
floor, one side of his face slick with his own blood, more 
pooling beneath his head. His eyes were closed. John 
grabbed his wrist and pressed his fingers against the veins, 
hoping for a pulse: after a few frantic seconds, he found it, 
and relief washed through him, but it was momentary. 
“Clay?” John repeated, jostling him lightly. Clay didn’t 
respond. John looked around with alarm; the new door, the 
one Clay had described as “reinforced,” was in pieces. What 
was left of the door was still hanging in place by the upper 
hinge. Hastily, John pulled Clay out into the hall as best he 
could. 

He glanced back toward the office: the chair was 
overturned, and everything that had been on the desk 
littered the carpet. He patted Clay’s shoulder. “You’re going 
to be okay,” he said hoarsely, and he went to the office 


phone and dialed 911. As he waited for an operator, he 
looked nervously back at the demolished door. Another 
surge of wind rushed through the front door and out the 
open window, seemingly to carry with it whatever horror 
had happened here. 





The hissing sound continued; there was no place to get 
away from it. Their pain came at random, for no reason they 
could discern, and they clung together in their confusion. 

“Hold still,” a voice said, and they trembled with fear, for 
they knew the terrifying voice well. Frozen like a frightened 
animal, trying to hide but completely exposed; inner, bloody 
screams silent to the world. The shadow blotted out the 
light from above. “Keep wiggling, and | will keep taking the 
parts of you that wiggle,” the voice growled. The hissing 
grew louder, and with a sudden snap, and a flash of 
shocking pain, the shadow withdrew, holding something in 
his hands. “I'll be back soon.” 


* OK 


“| was gone for less than an hour,” John said in a low voice, 
leaning in so Jessica could hear him over the sound of the 
hospital waiting room’s TV. “I came back, and he was lying 
there. If | had just stayed with him a little longer ...” He 
trailed off, and Jessica gave him a sympathetic look. He 
grabbed his backpack off the floor and put it in his lap, 
touching the front pocket to reassure himself that 
Theodore’s head was still where he’d stuffed it. 

“Do you think it was just someone with a grudge?” she 
asked, then flushed. “I don’t mean ‘just,’ like it’s not a big 
deal, but | mean, I’m sure Clay made his fair share of 
enemies, being the police chief. It probably didn’t have 
anything to do with ...” She glanced around and lowered her 
voice. “Anything to do with us.” 

John looked down at the backpack in his lap. “The door ... 
was shredded, Jess.” 

Jessica looked nervously down the hallway, like she was 
worried Clay might hear them. “Well, regardless, it’s not 
your fault.” 

A heavy silence settled in between them, only 
punctuated by the half-crazed voices coming from the TV, 
which was showing a montage of ghastly faced clowns. For 
a moment, John was distracted, searching for a glimpse of 
the apparition who had silently passed him in the street, but 
she was not among the crowd. 

“People are going crazy this weekend,” Jessica said, 
recalling his attention. “Dressing up in those costumes—did 
you hear about the kid who got kidnapped?” 

“Yeah,” John said. “Clay told me about it. Actually, when | 
went to see him—” John broke off as a nurse in blue scrubs 
walked up purposefully. 


“John, Jessica?” she said as if she already knew the 
answer. 

“Yeah, that’s us,” Jessica said, with a hint of anxiety. 

The nurse gave her a smile. “Chief Burke wants to see 
you. | tried to tell him visits are supposed to be immediate 
family only right now, but, well. Chief's orders.” 

The room was only a few doors down the hallway, but the 
bright lights and slick, grayish surfaces were disorienting. 
John squinted to ward off the offensive glare. Jessica was in 
front of him, and he bumped into her before he realized she 
had stopped just short of Clay’s door. 

“What's the matter?” he asked, confused as to why she 
was Standing still. 

She turned around and moved close to whisper: “Can you 
go in first?” 

“Yeah, of course,” he said, understanding. “He’s not that 
bad, Jess, | promise.” 

“Still.” She made a concerned face and stepped back so 
John could approach the doorway. 

The door was open: He could see Clay, apparently 
asleep. He was in a hospital gown, and with the blood 
cleaned from his face, his skin looked sallow. A line of black 
stitches ran from his forehead to his cheekbone, splitting his 
eyebrow. 

“He almost lost that eye.” 

Jessica jumped. The nurse had apparently followed them. 

“He looks pretty out of it,” John said quietly. “Are you sure 
he wanted to talk to us?” 

“He’s drifting in and out,” the nurse replied in a normal 
tone of voice. “Go ahead, it won’t hurt him to talk for a bit.” 

“Hey, Clay,” John said awkwardly as he approached the 
bed. “Carlton and Marla are on their way. They should be 


here soon.” Jessica looked sideways at the elderly woman 
asleep in the other bed, and the nurse stepped past her, 
closing the curtain between the two patients. 

“Privacy, if you can call it that,” the nurse said drily, and 
then left, closing the door partway behind her. 

As soon as she was out of the room, Clay’s eyes opened. 
“Good,” he said. His voice was reedy, and he didn’t lift his 
head from the pillow, but his eyes were sharp. “Don’t pull 
any plugs just yet, I’m still here,” Clay said lightly, and John 
gave him a wry smile. 

“Okay, not yet,” he agreed. 

“How are you feeling?” Jessica asked. 

“Get my jacket,” Clay said, pointing to the enclosure’s 
only chair, where a dark gray sport coat was draped over 
the back. Jessica hurried to get it, and Clay fumbled around 
with it for a minute, finally extracting a long white envelope 
from the inside breast pocket. He held it out to John, sitting 
up slightly; John took it and Clay fell back on the pillow, 
breathing heavily. 

“Take it easy,” John said, alarmed. 

Clay nodded weakly, his eyes closed. “It has to have a 
range,” he mumbled. 

“What?” Jessica leaned in beside John, and they 
exchanged a worried look. 

“It has to have a maximum range.” Clay’s head lolled to 
the side and his breath slowed: he seemed to be drifting out 
of consciousness again. 

“Should we get the nurse?” Jessica looked to John, who 
peered at the monitor, then shook his head. 

“His vitals look okay.” 

“You're not a doctor, John!” 


“Shut the door a little more?” John said, ignoring her. 
Jessica did as he asked begrudgingly, leaving it a few inches 
ajar. John turned the envelope over: It was unaddressed, 
sealed, and heavy. He opened it, and something small fell 
out: Jessica moved to grab it, and John took out the rest of 
the contents: It was a stack of photographs, about an inch 
thick. The top one was of him and Charlie in the restaurant 
only the night before. It seemed to have been shot from 
outside the building, through the front window. John 
continued to browse the photos: Each one tracked through 
his evening with Charlie until they had parted ways: eating, 
coming out of the restaurant, and saying good-bye, the 
pictures all taken from a distance. In some the image was 
askew, or the figures blurry—the photographer had not been 
interested in composition. There was a last shot in the 
sequence: Charlie walking away toward the crowd by the 
new pizzeria; John could make out the back of his own head 
in the bottom corner of the photo. He quickly put it behind 
the others and kept looking. The next sequence showed 
Jessica and Charlie in a clothing store, coming in and out of 
a dressing room in various outfits, talking and laughing. The 
pictures seemed to have been taken from the other side of 
the store—the edges of some were obscured by fabric, as if 
someone had been hiding behind a rack of clothes. 

John felt a stab of angry revulsion. The restaurant 
pictures were bad enough, but this seemed far more 
intrusive, an invasion of an intimate moment. He glanced at 
Jessica; she had moved to the window, holding something 
up to the light, and after a moment John realized that it was 
a Strip of film. He squinted over her shoulder, and she 
lowered it, turning to face him. 

“All the pictures on this are of us,” she said quietly. 


He held up the stack of pictures. “These, too.” 

Jessica held out a hand silently: He passed her half the 
stack and they each sorted through their share. The photos 
covered several more moments in time: there was a set of 
Jessica and Carlton meeting Charlie at a café; John showed 
one to Jessica and she nodded. “That’s when Charlie first 
got back,” she said. Her brow furrowed, and she held up a 
shot of her, Charlie, and Marla coming out of a building. 
“This is my apartment complex,” she said, her voice tense. 
“John, this looks like somebody hired a P.I. to follow all of us 
around. How did he get these? And why?” 

“Il don’t know,” John said slowly, looking back down at 
the photo in his hands, the last in the stack. The picture had 
been taken at night, outside, but the figures were clear: He 
himself was facing the camera, his hands shoved into his 
pockets. The despair on his face visible even at a distance. 
Charlie had her back to the camera; she was hugging 
herself so tightly that he could see her fingers gripping the 
back of her dress, a contorted, useless comfort. Charlie. His 
head was too tight, his chest ached. John reflexively bent 
the photo and put it in his pocket, then turned his head to 
make sure no one had noticed. Jessica said nothing. 

John cleared his throat. “The reason | went to see Clay 
was that | wanted to show him something.” 

“What is it?” Jessica stepped closer. John went to the 
door and peered out, then snuck a glance behind the curtain 
at the elderly woman. She was still asleep. He took off his 
backpack and got Theodore out. Jessica yelped, then 
Slapped a hand over her mouth. “Where did you get him?” 
she demanded. John took a step back, startled by her 
sudden, searing scrutiny. 

“What's wrong with you?” he asked. 


“It’s weird. | always hated that thing.” Jessica fluttered 
her hand by her face. “Charlie’s robotics experiments 
always creeped me out, but it’s kind of nice to see it.” 

“Well, this one has an interesting secret.” 

“Don’t let Charlie see it; she’s been throwing away things 
like that, anything from her dad. It’s probably some kind of 
five-step grief-acceptance thing, but still.” 

“No, I’m not going to show her this. This is going to 
sound crazy, but Theodore’s been ... talking to me, and 
yesterday—” He didn’t have to continue. A garbled, static- 
filled noise retched from the rabbit’s head, and Jessica 
winced. Before she could say anything, the sound changed. 

Now that he knew the words, they were perfectly clear; 
Jessica tilted her head to the side, listening intently. “Is he 
saying, ‘Silver Reef’?” she asked. 

“Shining Star. Shining Star, Silver Reef.” Theodore was 
still repeating the phrase, but John shoved him back into his 
backpack and covered him with a mostly clean T-shirt, 
muffling the sound. Remembering the pictures, he bundled 
them back into the envelope and added them to the bag 
before zipping it back up. “You got it quicker than | did,” he 
told Jessica. She nodded absently, a faraway look in her eye. 

“Silver Reef,” she repeated. 

“Does it mean anything to you?” he asked with a spark of 
hope. 

“It’s a town near Hurricane,” she said. 

“Maybe Charlie’s family used to live there?” John said. 
Jessica shook her head. 

“No. It’s a ghost town. Nobody lives there.” 

“Jessica! John!” Marla’s voice pierced the quiet, and they 
turned to see Carlton beside her, his face pale and tense. He 
brushed past the others and went straight to the bed. 


“Dad, are you okay?” He hovered beside Clay, reaching 
out to touch his hand, then pulling away. “Is he okay?” he 
glanced back at the others, and Marla hurried forward, 
examining the monitors. 

“He’s okay, Carlton,” Marla said, putting a hand on his 
shoulder, and he nodded sharply, not taking his eyes off 
Clay’s still face. 

“He'll be fine,” John said, trying to sound confident. “He 
was just awake, talking. The nurse said he’s going to be 
Okay.” 

“What happened?” Carlton asked quietly, and John shook 
his head. 

“| don’t know,” he said helplessly. “I got there too late.” 
Carlton didn’t answer, but pulled a chair up beside the bed 
and sat down. He rested his chin on his fist, hunching over. 

“It'll be okay,” Marla repeated, then glanced around the 
room with a puzzled expression. “Where did she go?” 

“Who's with you?” Jessica asked alarmingly, looking to 
John. John was looking at the door: Charlie had stopped just 
outside the room. 

“Charlie. Hey, come in,” he spoke loudly, wondering with 
guilt if she had heard any of the conversation that had taken 
place. She stepped into the room, but hung back. John 
glanced at his backpack, on the floor at the foot of Clay’s 
bed. The noise seemed to have stopped, to his relief. When 
he looked up, Charlie gave him an embarrassed half smile. 

“| don’t like hospitals very much,” she said softly. “Is he 
okay?” She didn’t turn her head, and John realized that she 
was deliberately staying where she couldn’t see Clay. 

“He’s going to be,” he said. “He’s doing okay.” She 
nodded, but stayed where she was, looking unconvinced. 


“He’s lucky you were there!” Marla exclaimed. “John, you 
must have saved his life.” 

“Um, maybe,” he said. “I don’t know.” He squeezed her 
hand, then let go of it. He turned back to Charlie; she gave 
him a small, tight smile, her arms folded. The nurse came 
in, and Marla intercepted her, pulling her aside for an 
update on his condition and Jessica took the opportunity to 
lean in. “John, I’m going to leave. I’ve got classes this 
afternoon. Pick me up at seven, don’t be late.” 

“Right,” John whispered. Jessica made her way past 
everyone and through the door. Charlie watched her until 
she was out of sight, then she looked at John again, making 
eye contact for only a moment before turning her attention 
back to the nurse. John glanced around the room: with 
Jessica gone, he felt suddenly untethered, less at ease 
among these people than he already had been. Without 
another word, he slipped out the door, ignoring the soft 
sound of Marla calling his name. 

He was only a few feet down the hall when Jessica caught 
his arm. “John!” 

“Hey!” he protested, then saw there was someone next 
to her, a slight, blonde woman who looked like she had been 
crying, her red eyes the only color in her washed-out face. 
“What’s wrong?” he asked warily. 

“This is Anna,” Jessica said. “Clay ... Chief Burke was—is 
—helping her to ...” She cleared her throat. “Her son is 
missing. Chief Burke was helping.” 

“Oh,” John said awkwardly. “I’m so sorry, ma’am.” Anna 
blew her nose into a crumpled tissue. 

“| was just at the station and | overheard ... they said 
Chief Burke was here, and | just needed to know he’s okay. 
Is he okay?” she asked anxiously. 


“He’s going to be fine,” Jessica said, and Anna nodded, 
not seeming convinced. 

“When | went to report that Jacob ... was missing, the 
desk sergeant had me fill out paperwork, he asked me 
about my ex-husband and said he had probably taken Jacob. 
| told him, that man would never take Jacob, he wouldn’t 
know what to do with him!” 

“Okay,” John said, shifting uncomfortably. “We don’t work 
for the police department—” 

“Il know that,” she said quickly, shaking her head. “I’m 
sorry, | can’t think straight, it’s just | overheard the nurse in 
the waiting room talking to you before. Chief Burke was 
there when the sergeant was telling me to call my ex- 
husband; he took me aside and asked me questions, he said 
he was going to find my son, and | believed him.” 

“He’s a good officer,” Jessica said softly. “He’s a good 
person. He’ll find your son.” Anna pressed her hand to her 
mouth, stifling a sob as she began to cry again. 

“Is he really going to be all right? | heard ...” She broke 
off, and John put a hand on her shoulder. 

“He’s going to be all right,” he said firmly. “We just saw 
him; he talked to us.” Anna nodded, but didn’t look 
convinced. Jessica gave John a helpless glance. He racked 
his brain for something to say. “He will find—Jacob, was it?” 
he asked, and Anna nodded tearfully. 

“Anna!” An older woman rounded the corner briskly, and 
Anna turned at the sound of her name. 

“Mom,” she said, the strain in her voice easing slightly. 
Her mother wrapped her arms around her, and Anna held on 
tightly, crying into her shoulder. 

“It'll be all right,” Anna’s mother whispered. Thank you, 
she mouthed silently to John and Jessica, and they nodded, 


exchanged a glance, and headed for the hospital entrance. 

As soon as they were in the parking lot, Jessica let out a 
gasp like she had been holding her breath, and hugged John 
fiercely. He put his arms around her, surprised. “It'll be all 
right,” he said, and she pushed him away. 

“Will it?” she asked, her eyes bright with tears. “It’s nice 
to tell that poor woman that Clay will find her son, but, John, 
you and | both know that when kids go missing in this town 
... they don’t get found.” John shook his head. He wanted to 
argue with her, but there was something leaden in the pit of 
his stomach. 

“It doesn’t have to end like that this time,” he said 
without conviction, and Jessica straightened, wiping her 
eyes like it was a gesture of defiance. 

“It can’t. It can’t end like that again, John. If that little boy 
is mixed up in all this, we have to find him and bring him 
home. For Michael.” 

John nodded, and before she could answer, she strode to 
her car and drove away, leaving him alone in the parking 
lot. 


* OK OX 


That night, John had barely stopped in front of Jessica’s 
building when she came running out. She opened the car 
door and jumped in with lightning speed. “Go,” she said 
urgently, and he hit the gas. 

“What's wrong, what happened?” he asked. 

“Just drive, hurry.” 

“Okay, put on your seat belt!” he scolded as they veered 
around a corner. 


“Sorry! Everything is fine,” she said. “I just don’t like 
thinking someone could be out there stalking me.” 

“Yeah,” he agreed, peering into the rearview mirror. “But 
it’s dark out; we should be okay.” 

“That doesn’t make me feel better.” 

“So, what do you think?” John said after a moment. “Did 
you notice anything about the photos?” 

“That they’re enough to get a restraining order in most 
states?” she joked, but there was real anxiety in her voice. 

“None of them were of just one of us,” he said. “And 
none of them were just you and me, or just you and Marla.” 

“You mean it’s about Charlie,” Jessica said, 
understanding immediately. 

“Isn't everything?” John said drily. The words sounded 
bitter, though he had not meant them to, and he glanced at 
Jessica, trying to gauge her reaction. She was staring out 
the window like she hadn’t heard him. 

In less than half an hour, they were at the ghost town. 
John stopped the car beside a wooden sign reading WELCOME 
TO SILVER REEF, and got out; Jessica followed. It was an odd 
mix, even in the dark: in the distance they could see the 
crumbling walls of buildings that would never be restored, 
and close by were the places rebuilt for tourists: a church, a 
museum, and a few others John couldn’t make out. 

“John, we’re going to get killed out here,” Jessica said, 
briefly losing her balance on the loose dirt and gravel. 

“When exactly did people last live here?” John asked 
quietly. 

“Late eighteen-hundreds | think. Silver mining town, 
hence the name.” 


The town appeared even more abandoned than they 
were expecting, possibly closed to tourists for the season, 
but on distant hills there were scattered lights. John turned 
in a circle, wishing Theodore had been just a little more 
forthcoming. “What does ‘Shining Star’ mean, anyway?” he 
muttered to himself. He looked up: the night was clear, and 
the sky was awash in stars, with no city lights to drown 
them out. 

“It’s beautiful,” Jessica murmured. 

“Yeah, but not helpful,” John said, rubbing the back of his 
neck. He turned around again, and then he Saw it. “Shining 
Star,” he said. 

“What?” Jessica turned, then squinted and tried to follow 
his eye line. 

A few yards back the way they’d come was a wooden 
archway leading into a field; at the peak of the arch, was a 
single silver star. 

The field was wide, sloping upward, and at the top of the 
hill, John could see the outline of a house. It was scarcely 
visible: had it not been for the guidance of Theodore’s 
mumbling head, it wouldn’t have stood out from anything 
else in the canopy of silhouettes. With wordless agreement, 
they passed under the star, leaving the remains of the town 
behind them. The black field soon consumed their line of 
sight in all directions, with only the faint discoloration of a 
winding gravel path to guide their steps. 

As they made their way up the hill, a small, squarish one- 
story house came into view; there were windows on each 
outfacing wall, but only one was lit, in the back. They slowed 
their pace as they reached the front door: there was only 
one concrete step, unusually high and wide. John reached 
out a hand to help Jessica up. She didn’t really need it, 


being five times the athlete that he was, but it still seemed 
polite. The front door was unwelcoming, the little, lightless 
lamps almost hidden, offering no help. John looked around 
for a doorbell and couldn't find one, so he knocked. There 
was no sound of movement from inside. Jessica leaned to 
the side, trying to see through the windows. John had raised 
his hand to try again when the door creaked open, and a 
tall, dark-haired woman peered out, staring at them coldly. 

“Aunt Jen?” John asked meekly, stepping back 
instinctively before he could stop himself. He recognized 
her, but standing face-to-face, he felt almost as though they 
had come to this house at random. Jen tilted her head, her 
dark eyes fixing on him. 

“I’m someone’s aunt Jen, yes,” she said drily. “But | don’t 
believe I’m yours.” She stayed where she was, one hand on 
the doorframe and the other on the knob; she was blocking 
the entry as if she thought they might try to force their way 
in. 

“I’m a friend of Charlie’s,” John said, and a ghost of an 
expression flickered on her face. 

“And?” she said. 

“I’m John. This is Jessica,” he added, realizing she had 
not yet spoken. Jessica would usually have jumped in as the 
social director, but she was leaving this to him, looking back 
nervously as though she suspected someone was creeping 
through the dark. John glanced back at her, and she gave 
him a little, encouraging nod to go on. “I’m here because | 
got a message,” he said. She waited patiently, and John 
took off his backpack and took Theodore out; Jessica 
reached forward to take the empty bag, and he held the 
rabbit’s head up. Jen showed no surprise, only curling her lip 
Slightly. 


“Hello, Theodore,” she said calmly. “You’ve seen better 
days, haven’t you?” 

John smiled reflexively, then hardened his features. 

“Shining Star, Silver Reef,” John said, but Jen didn’t react. 
“| have to say, this is a strange place to call home,” he said, 
though what he wanted to say was, You owe us an 
explanation. 

“A message.” She looked at Theodore’s head, then 
looked accusingly over her shoulder, though all that was 
visible behind her was a dark hallway. 

“Did you want us to come here? | don’t understand,” John 
pressed. 

“Why don’t you come inside,” Jen said, stepping back, 
then closing the door with haste as soon as they were 
inside. The house was spare: the furniture was dark and 
plain, and there was little of it. The walls were thick with 
layered wallpapers, rich with vintage designs from decades 
past, but there was nothing hanging on them, though John 
Saw nail holes and marks where decorations had once been. 
Jen ushered them through a living room with only two chairs 
and an end table, into a small room almost entirely filled by 
a square, black-stained dinner table. There were four 
matching chairs, and Jen pulled out the one closest to the 
door, then sat down. 

“Please,” she said, gesturing to the other chairs. John and 
Jessica made their way around the table to face her, as she 
stared into the middle distance. 

“So, is this where Charlie grew up?” Jessica asked 
awkwardly as she sat down. 

“No.” 

“So, then you moved here recently?” John asked 
suspiciously, refusing to believe someone would select this 


house by choice. 

“How is Charlie?” Jen said slowly. “Did she know about 
the message as well?” Jen made a discreet glance at the 
window behind them, then focused back on John. 

“No,” John said plainly. Jen nodded; she was still staring 
into space, and he had a sudden but profound impression 
that there was something in the room that only she could 
see. 

“We want to help Charlie. Is there anything going on that 
we need to know about?” Jessica asked, and Jen snapped to 
attention. 

“Charlie is my concern. She’s my responsibility.” Jen 
spoke with an air of pure self-assurance, and something in it 
must have struck Jessica: she straightened, lifting her chin 
to match Jen’s posture. 

“Charlie’s our friend, she’s our concern, too,” Jessica 
said. 

There was silence, and John flicked his eyes back and 
forth between the two women, waiting. A long moment 
passed, the two of them staring at each other, immobile, 
and John realized he was holding his breath. 

“Jen,” he said, plunging in. “A friend gave us pictures 
someone had been taking of Charlie, and of us.” He 
unzipped his backpack, and that noise snapped Jessica and 
Jen out of their staring contest. He pulled the pictures Clay 
had given them out of their envelope, leaving the film, and 
placed them in front of Jen on the table. “If you want to take 
responsibility for Charlie, look at these and tell me if they 
mean anything to you.” 

She began going through the stack, peering intently at 
each photo, then putting each aside, making a second, neat 


pile of discards. “Why don’t you ask your detective friend 
what they mean?” she asked. 

“Because last night our detective friend was nearly 
murdered,” John said. Jen didn’t respond, and continued her 
methodical progress through the pictures. When she had 
gone through all the pictures, she looked up at John. Her 
expression had softened slightly; the hostility had given way 
to something else, a discomfort, and fear. 

“Is this all?” she asked. “Is there anything else?” She 
cleared her throat. 

“He said something before he lost consciousness.” 

“And what was that?” 

John looked to Jessica briefly, then back to Jen. “‘It has to 
have a range. It has to have a maximum range.’” He looked 
at her expectantly, but she showed no sign of recognition. 

“I! don’t know what that means,” she said. She put her 
chin in her hand, staring down again at the first picture in 
the stack, then she shook her head. “I know you mean 
well.” She leaned back in the wooden chair, looking from 
John to Jessica and back again. “I should tell you to go away, 
to forget her. All these years ...” She trailed off, then gave 
each of them a piercing look. “Secrets petrify you. You 
harden yourself against the world to keep them safe, and 
the longer you keep them, the harder you become. Then 
one day you look in the mirror, and you realize you’ve 
turned to stone.” She smiled sadly. “I’m sorry.” 

“You're not going to tell us anything? We’re here to help. 
We're Charlie’s friends!” Jessica insisted. 

“If | didn’t plan on telling you anything | wouldn’t have 
anything to be sorry about,” Jen said, her mouth almost 
forming a smile. John collected the photos to put back in his 
bag. 


“If you have something to tell us—do it now, or we’re 
leaving. | may not know much, but I Know that girl isn’t 
Charlie, or she is under some kind of influence.” He waited 
for a response, but none came. “She isn’t herself,” he 
added, sounding more desperate than before. Jen looked up 
at them: her rigid face had broken, tears were in her eyes. 

A knock came from the front door, and even Jen startled. 
She looked to the door, then back to John and Jessica. Her 
face was grave. “That way,” she said in a voice barely 
above a whisper, pointing down a narrow hallway. “Close the 
door behind you.” The knock came again; John touched 
Jessica’s arm and nodded, and they got up from the table, 
careful not to let the chairs make noise as they dragged 
across the floor. 

The hallway was dark, the only light coming from the 
room they had just left, and John kept a hand on the wall for 
balance. After a second his eyes adjusted, and he could see 
an open door at the end of the hall. 

“John, come on,” Jessica whispered, grabbing his arm 
briefly as she brushed past him and hurried into the room. 

“Yeah,” he said, and stopped moving as his fingers 
touched the frame of a door. 

“John!” Jessica hissed. John tried the door. It opened 
easily; he peered in, and recoiled. 

Someone’s in there! 

“John!” Jessica whispered urgently as the knock at the 
door came again. John didn’t move. 

It took only a second for him to register that the figure in 
the closet was not a person. It was about his height, with a 
roughly human shape, but it resembled nothing that had 
ever been alive. John stepped closer and took his keys from 
his pocket. He switched on the keyring penlight, and swept 


it up and down quickly. His heart stopped. It was a skeleton, 
metal and naked wires, encased in nothing. Its arms hung at 
its sides, and its head was bowed, exposing its open skull, 

the circuits silent and lightless. Its face was bare and metal. 

“john!” Jessica was standing behind the door at the end 
of the hall, holding it open just a crack as she waited for 
him. John closed the closet door, blinded again in the 
darkness, and walked toward the sound of her voice like a 
beacon. His steps took ages, the air like molasses, as the 
thing in the closet echoed in his mind like a gunshot, 
drowning out everything else. 

In a daze, John reached the end of the hall as Jessica 
beckoned frantically. She grabbed his arm and pulled him 
inside, carefully closing the door behind him. 

“What's wrong with you? John, what was in that closet?” 
she whispered, still holding on to his arm, her nails digging 
in, bringing him closer to reality. 

“It was ...” He swallowed. /t was holding a knife. “It was 
the machine Charlie’s father built to kill himself,” he said 
hoarsely. Jessica’s eyes widened, and she stared at him like 
he was a ghost. 

The knock came again, much louder, and they both 
jumped. This time they could hear Jen’s footsteps walking 
toward the sound. Jessica bent and pressed her ear to the 
keyhole. “Do you see anything?” John whispered. The front 
door creaked as it opened. 

“Charlie,” John could hear Jen say. “What a nice surprise. 
Jessica twisted around in her crouched posture. 

“Charlie’s here?” she said, scarcely whispering, and John 
shrugged. 

“Aunt Jen, it’s so wonderful to see you again,” Charlie’s 
voice came through faintly, but clear. Jessica stayed where 


” 


she was, listening for more, but John was restless, and he 
looked around the room. 

They were in a bedroom—at least, there was a bed—but 
it was mostly filled with cardboard boxes and old-fashioned 
wooden trunks. John stumbled around them for a moment, 
then froze, looking as though something had just occurred 
to him. He knelt quietly and opened one of the chests, 
moving slowly to make no sound. 

“John, what are you doing?” Jessica whispered angrily. 

“Something isn’t right here,” John breathed, glancing at 
the door. “Come on, this might be our only chance to find 
out what she’s up to.” John shuffled through some of the 
papers in the first chest, then closed the lid and flipped up 
the top of a nearby cardboard box: It was filled with 
computer parts and mechanisms he didn’t recognize. A 
second and third held massive tangles of electric cable. 
“This looks like stuff I’d expect to find in Charlie’s room,” he 
murmured to himself. 

“Shhh!” Jessica hissed, pressing her ear back against the 
door to the hall. 

“What's going on out there?” John said under his breath. 
“I can barely hear anything.” 

Jessica shook her head. 

“Let me know if you hear someone coming.” John moved 
to a large green chest, the paint almost entirely worn off. 
There was no lock. John knelt beside it, found the handle, 
and heaved it open, then shuddered, falling back and 
pushing himself away. 

“Jessica,” he gasped, moving back to the chest and 
leaning over it. 

“Shhhh!” Jessica hissed from the door, listening intently. 

“Jessica.” 


“What, John? I’m trying to listen.” 

“It’s ... it’s Charlie,” he said hoarsely. “In the chest.” 

“What?” Jessica whispered. She turned around in 
annoyance, her face falling. She dropped to her knees and 
crawled to the chest, where John had gone back to looking 
down at what lay inside. Charlie was curled up in the fetal 
position; she looked like she was sleeping, with a pillow 
under her head and blankets surrounding her. Her brown 
hair was a mess; her face was round; and she was wearing 
light gray sweatpants and a sweatshirt, both too large for 
her. John stared, his heart pounding so hard he could hear 
nothing but the rush of his own blood, not daring to hope, 
until: she took a breath, and then another. She’s alive. John 
reached down into the trunk and touched her cheek: it was 
too cool. His mind snapped out of its first shock. We have to 
get her out of here; she’s sick. He stood and reached 
awkwardly into the trunk, then gently, cautiously, lifted her 
out. He looked down at her in his arms, astonished, all his 
thoughts wordless, except, Charlie. 


* OK OX 


Don’t let me go—let go of me, what’s happening? Someone 
touched her cheek, a brief, startling spot of warmth. It was 

gone just as quickly, leaving her colder than before. Come 

back, she tried to say, but she could not remember how to 

make the words come out. 

“Charlie.” That’s my name, someone Is saying my name. 
Charlie tried to open her eyes. / know that voice. Someone's 
arms reached down under her, lifting her from the cramped, 
dark place she’d been so long that memories of somewhere 
else seemed like dreams. She still couldn’t open her eyes. A 


woman said something. / know them. She couldn't 
remember their names. 

The first voice came again, it was a man’s voice, and she 
felt its reverberation as he pulled her against his chest, 
holding her like a child. Warmth radiated from him; he was 
solid and alive. Even standing still, he was filled with 
movement: She could hear his heartbeat, just beside her 
ear. / am alive. He said something else, and the rumble of it 
shook her whole body; the woman answered, and then she 
was jostled painfully. We’re going somewhere. She still 
couldn’t open her eyes. 

“It’s gonna be okay, Charlie,” he whispered, and the 
sleeping world began to pull her down again. / want to stay! 
She began to panic, then as she slipped into 
unconsciousness again, she grabbed hold of the last words 
he’d said. /t’s gonna be okay. 


* OK OX 


John clutched Charlie to his chest, then relaxed his grip 
anxiously, afraid of hurting her. 

“How are we going to get her out?” Jessica whispered, 
and he glanced around the room. There was a window, but it 
was high and narrow: getting all three of them through it 
would take time. 

“We'll have to run for it,” he said in a low voice. “Wait 
until ... she leaves.” Jessica met his eyes, her face written 
over with all the questions he had been asking himself for 
the last six months. 

A scream ripped through the silence between them, and 
John came alert. Someone screamed again, and the room 
shuddered with impact from somewhere in the house. John 


looked around wildly for an escape, and his eyes lit ona 
closet door. “There,” he said, nodding toward it. Another 
bang came, and the wall beside them shook; another 
scream, and then a scrabbling sound, like an animal 
scratching at the door. “Hurry,” John whispered, but Jessica 
was already clearing a path. She moved ahead of him, 
moving aside boxes as quickly and soundlessly as she could, 
and he carried Charlie carefully behind, his whole being 
focused on holding her safe. Jessica shoved coats on 
hangers aside, making room, and they crammed themselves 
into the space. 

“It’s gonna be okay, Charlie,” John whispered. Jessica 
closed the door behind them, then stopped, her hand on the 
knob. 

“Wait,” she whispered. 

“What?” 

Jessica ran back across the room carelessly, her steps 
thudding on the wood floor. 

“Jessica, what are you doing?” John hissed, shrinking 
back farther into the recess of the closet, awkwardly 
Shielding Charlie’s head from hangers and hooks with his 
elbow. Jessica reached the window, snapped open the lock, 
and threw it open with a loud bang. John gaped as Jessica 
raced on tiptoe back to the closet, this time making no 
noise. She nestled in beside him, leaving the door open just 
a crack, and rested a hand on Charlie’s shoulder. 

Within an instant, the bedroom door opened, and 
someone stepped through. The light from the rest of the 
house filtered in dimly, and through the tiny crack in the 
door, they could barely make out a silhouette in red, walking 
purposefully across the room. The figure paused for a 


moment, looking outside, then with a rush of movement too 
quick to follow, vanished out the window. 

John stood stock still, his heart pounding, half expecting 
the mysterious figure to appear again in front of them. 
Charlie’s unconscious weight was starting to drag on his 
arms, and he shifted uncomfortably, trying not to jostle her. 

“Come on,” Jessica said. He nodded, though she couldn’t 
see him. Jessica pushed the door open cautiously, and they 
were met with silence. They made their way to the hall, and 
stopped short again: Jen was slumped on the floor, blood 
spattering the wall behind her like an abstract mural, and 
pooled beneath her, trickling across the floor in little 
rivulets. John raised his hand to cover Charlie’s face. There 
was no doubt that Jen was dead: her eyes glazed and 
dimmed with the marble stare of death, her stomach laid 
open. 

“We have to go,” he said hoarsely, and they turned from 
the grotesque scene and hurried out of the house. They ran 
headlong down the hill. John stumbled on the uneven 
gravel, barely catching himself, and Jessica turned back. 
“Go,” he grunted, and clutched Charlie tighter, slowing his 
pace just a little. 

At last they reached the car, and Jessica opened the back 
door and got in, then scooted over to the far side and 
reached out to help him put Charlie inside. Together they 
laid her across the back seat, placing her head in Jessica’s 
lap. John started the car. 

As they sped through the night he kept checking the 
rearview mirror, reassuring himself: Charlie still slept, as 
Jessica twined her fingers in her hair, looking down at her 
face in wonder. John met her eyes in the mirror and saw his 
own thoughts on her face: She’s here. She’s alive.

Charlie raced down the hill, exhilarated, almost leaping—she 
felt like if she went fast enough she might take off and fly. 
Her heart was beating in a new rhythm; the night air was 
cool and fresh, and all her senses felt heightened: she could 
see anything, hear anything—do anything. 

She reached the bottom of the hill and took off up the 
next one—she had parked her car behind it. She smiled into 
the night, picturing Aunt Jen’s face in the moment it had 
dawned on her what was about to happen. That smooth, 
near-impermeable calm had ruptured; the cold-blooded 
woman had become a soft, frightened animal in the space 
of an instant. At /Jeast she had the dignity not to beg, Charlie 
thought. Or maybe she just knew it wouldn’t help. She 
shivered, then shrugged. 

They had been having pleasantries, then Charlie gave Jen 
a wide, cruel smile, and Jen screamed. Charlie advanced on 
her, and she screamed again; this time Charlie choked off 
the noise, grabbing Aunt Jen by the throat. She lifted her off 
her feet, and slammed her into a door with such force it 
clattered in its hinges. Her aunt tried to crawl away, and she 
caught her by her hair, now sticky with blood, and threw her 
into the wall again. This time she did not try to run, and 
Charlie crouched beside her and put a hand around her 
throat again, taking her time now, relishing the feeling of 
her aunt’s pulse beneath her fingers, and the terrified look 
in her eyes. Jen opened and closed her mouth, gawping like 
a fish, and Charlie watched for a moment, considering. 

“Is there something you'd like to say?” she asked 
mockingly. Jen made a tiny, pained nod, and Charlie leaned 
in close so she could whisper, keeping an iron grip on her 


throat. Jen took a thin, rattling breath, and Charlie 
reluctantly lightened the pressure enough to let her speak. 

Her aunt wheezed for a moment, trying twice to speak 
before the words made it out. “I’ve always ... loved you ... 
Charlie.” 

Charlie pulled back and gave Aunt Jen a calmed look. “1 
love you, too,” she said softly, and then she ripped open her 
stomach. “I really do.” 

Charlie reached her car; she was running so fast she ran 
a few yards past it before she could stop. She wanted to 
keep running, to keep this feeling alive. She opened and 
closed her fists; the blood on them was tacky and growing 
uncomfortable. She started the car and opened the trunk to 
get the first-aid kit she always carried. Standing in the beam 
of the headlights, Charlie took out some gauze and 
hydrogen peroxide and carefully wiped her hands clean 
finger by finger. When she was done, she examined them 
and nodded, satisfied; then she got in her car and sped off 
into the dark. 





John was counting Charlie’s breaths, one-two, three-four, in- 
out, each intake of air a marker of the time going by: that 
this was real, that she was not going to vanish. Hours had 
passed, and the sky outside was lightening, but still he 
could not take his eyes off her. His bed was narrow; she was 
curled on her side as she had been in the trunk, her back 
pressed against the wall, and he was perched on the edge, 
careful not to touch her. Jessica had taken a brief nap on the 
couch, and now she was up again, pacing the short length of 
his bedroom. 

“John, we have to take her to a hospital,” Jessica said for 
the second time since she awoke, and he shook his head. 

“We don’t even know what’s wrong with her,” he said 
softly. Jessica made a frustrated noise in her throat. 


“That’s all the more reason to take her to a hospital,” she 
said, biting the words off individually. 

“| don’t think she'll be safe.” 

“You think she’s safe here?” 

John didn’t answer. One-two, three-four, in-out—he 
realized he was counting her breaths again, and he looked 
away. He could still hear her breathing, though, and the 
count went on nine-ten, eleven-twelve ... He could feel her 
presence beside him; even though they weren’t touching, 
he had a constant awareness that she was close by. 

“John?” Jessica prompted, and he looked first at Charlie, 
then at Jessica. 

“Clay said something,” he said. 

“At the hospital?” Jessica frowned. “Something else?” 

“No, before that. He had Ella at his house.” 

“That creepy doll from Charlie’s bedroom?” 

John hid a smile, remembering. Jessica will like Ella, 
Charlie had once confided to John. She dresses like her. But 
when Charlie had spun the wheel at the end of her bed, the 
one that made Ella glide out from the closet on her track, 
proffering her little tea tray, Jessica took one look at the 
toddler-size doll, screamed, and ran out of the room. 

“Yeah, the creepy doll,” he confirmed, his thoughts 
returning to the present. Jessica made an exaggerated 
shudder. 

“Il don’t know how she could ever sleep, knowing that 
thing was in the closet.” 

“It wasn’t the only closet,” John said, furrowing his brow. 
“There were two more; Ella was in the littlest one.” 

“Well, it wasn’t the location that creeped me out; I’m fine 
with closets ... | take that back, | didn’t like the last one we 
were in,” Jessica said drily. 


“| wish | could go back to that house—” 

“Charlie’s old house? It collapsed; it’s gone,” Jessica 
interrupted him, and he sighed. 

“Ella turned up in the wreckage, but Clay said Charlie 
wasn’t interested in keeping her. It seemed so unlike her; 
her father made that doll for her.” 

“Yeah.” Jessica stopped pacing and leaned against the 
wall, letting everything sink in. “You were right, John.” She 
opened her hands in a helpless gesture. “The other Charlie, 
she’s an imposter; you were right. So, what do we do?” 

John looked down again at Charlie, who stirred in her 
Sleep. “Charlie?” he whispered. 

She made a plaintive sound, then was still again. 

John glanced thoughtfully at his dresser. After a moment, 
he went to it and began digging through the top drawer. 

“What are you looking for?” Jessica asked. 

“There was an old photo, one | found when Charlie and | 
were looking through her dad’s stuff. It was Charlie when 
she was little. | know it’s in here somewhere.” 

Jessica watched him for a moment, then leaned over as 
something caught her attention. She crouched beside the 
dresser and pulled at the corner of something sticking out 
from underneath. “This?” she asked. 

“Yeah, that’s it.” John took the picture carefully and 
studied it. 

“John, | realize you’re having a sentimental moment right 
now, but we really need to get Charlie to the hospital.” 
Jessica peered over his shoulder. “What is all of that stuff 
behind her in the picture? Cups and plates?” 

“She was having a tea party,” John whispered. “I have to 
go to Clay’s house,” he added after a moment. 

“Clay’s still in the hospital.” 


“| have to go back to his house. Stay here. Take care of 
Charlie.” 

“What’s going on?” Jessica demanded as John grabbed 
his car keys from the dresser. “What am | supposed to do if 
Not-Charlie shows up? You saw what she did to Aunt Jen; she 
was probably the one who got Clay. And now she’s gonna be 
after Charlie, too, our Charlie.” John stopped, rubbing his 
temples with one hand. 

“Don’t let her in,” he said finally. “Bolt the door after me, 
push the couch across the door. I'll be back.” 

“John!” 

He left. He waited on the stoop until he heard the 
deadbolt fall into place, then hurried to his car.

John pulled into Clay Burke’s driveway too fast, slamming on 
the breaks and skidding onto the lawn. He rang the doorbell 
and waited long enough to confirm that no one was there, 
tried the knob and found it locked, then tried to act casual 
as he strolled around to the back of the house. He didn’t 
think the neighbors could see through the hedges 
separating the houses, but there was no reason not to be 
careful. The back door off the kitchen was closed as well, so 
he made his way along the outside wall, looking for a 
window that would open. The living room was where he 
found it: the window was unlocked, and after a few minutes 
of fiddling, he was able to get the screen up, then haul 
himself over the sill, scraping his back against the window 
frame as he squeezed through. 

He landed in a crouch, and stayed there for a moment, 
listening. The house had a thick hush, and a closed-up, stale 


smell; Carlton must have slept at the hospital. John got up 
and went to Clay’s study, not bothering to be quiet. 

He balked when he saw the wreckage: he hadn't 
forgotten the scene: the door smashed, the furniture 
upturned, and papers scattered over the floor like carpeting, 
but it was still a shock to see it. There was also a dark stain 
on the floor where he’d found Clay lying. John stepped over 
it carefully and went into the office. 

He scanned the room quickly: only one corner remained 
undisturbed: Ella was standing there almost concealed 
behind a standing lamp, her tea tray steady in front of her. 

“Hey, Ella,” he said suspiciously. “Do you have something 
that you want to tell me?” he said as he turned his attention 
to the clutter in the room. There were three empty 
cardboard boxes beside the desk, and he went there first: it 
looked like their contents had been dumped out in one big 
pile. Sifting through quickly, he saw that they were all 
related to Freddy Fazbear’s: photographs, papers of 
incorporation, tax forms, police reports, even menus. 
“Where do | start?” he murmured. He came to a photograph 
of Charlie and her father: Charlie was smiling; her father 
was holding her on his hip, pointing to something in the 
distance. He set it down and kept looking. Among the 
papers and photos were other things; the random computer 
chips and mechanical parts that seemed to turn up 
everywhere. He checked his watch; he was getting nervous 
at leaving Jessica alone with Charlie so long. He looked at 
Ella in the corner. “You know what I’m looking for, don’t 
you?” he asked the doll, then sighed and went back to the 
pile. 

On his hands and knees, he surveyed the area, and this 
time noticed a small cardboard box beneath Clay’s desk. It 


was only a few inches across, sealed with packing tape, but 
a corner had ripped open, spilling out part of its contents: 
John could see a bolt and a small strand of copper wire 
stuck to the tape on the outside. He crawled under the desk 
and grabbed it, then ripped the hole wider, not bothering 
with the tape. He stood and dumped out the rest of it on 
Clay’s desk; it was filled with more wires and parts. John 
shook the box and it rattled, and he banged on it until the 
thing that was stuck came out: a square circuit board 
attached to a tangle of wires. He studied it for a second 
before putting it aside and dropped the box, then spread the 
parts across the desk’s surface in a single layer, then sat 
down and peered at them one by one, hoping for something 
familiar. 

It took less than ten seconds to find it: a thin disc about 
the size of a half-dollar coin. His heart skipped, and he held 
the thing up, squinting at it until he saw the tiny words 
engraved along the edge in flowing, old-fashioned script: 
AFTON ROBOTICS, LLC. He swallowed, remembering the 
incapacitating nausea the last disc produced in him; he also 
remembered the more substantial effects the disc was 
capable of. 

John glanced back at Ella, then stood and approached 
her. He knelt beside her, holding the disc firmly in his hand, 
with his thumbnail under the switch on its side. John’s 
balance wavered. He set his jaw firmly and flipped the 
switch. 

In an instant, Ella was gone. In her place was a human 
child, a toddler. She had short, frizzy brown hair and a round 
face set in a happy smile; her chubby hands gripped the tea 
tray determinedly. Only her absolute stillness indicated that 


she was not alive. That, and her vacant eyes, staring 
sightlessly ahead. 

“Can you hear me?” he asked softly. There was no 
movement; the little girl was no more responsive than Ella. 
He reached out to touch her cheek, then pulled his hand 
back suddenly, revolted: her skin was warm and pliable— 
alive. He stood and went back to the desk, keeping his eyes 
on the girl. John clawed at the tiny switch again, flipping it 
back, and the toddler shimmered and blurred for a second, 
then the image solidified: Ella stood calmly in her place 
again, nothing more than a large toy doll. John sat down 
heavily. “Maximum range,” he muttered to himself, recalling 
Clay’s brief moment of consciousness at the hospital. But 
the photographs he’d insisted on giving them hadn’t 
revealed anything. Or had they? 

He went to Clay’s desk and picked up the phone: There 
was a dial tone; it had not been damaged when the place 
was ransacked. He dialed his own number. Please pick up, 
Jessica, he thought. 


“Hello?” 

“Jessica, it’s me.” 
“Who’s me?” 
“John!” 


“Right, sorry. I’m a little jumpy. Charlie’s fine—I mean, 
she’s still asleep; she’s not worse.” 

“Good. That’s not why | called, though. | need you to 
meet me at the library—bring the envelope Clay gave us, 
it’s In my backpack.” 

“All the pictures are gone,” Jessica said. “We left them at 
Jen’s house when we fled for our lives, remember?” she 
added with a hint of sarcasm. 


“| know. We don’t need the pictures. There was a roll of 
microfilm in the envelope.” 

There was a pause on the other end, then, “I'll see you 
there.” 

John turned to look at Ella, scratching his thumb 
thoughtfully across the surface of the disc. “And you; you’re 
coming with me,” he said quietly to Ella. He picked her up 
gingerly, repelled by what he had seen, but she felt just like 
the doll she seemed to be. She was large enough to be 
awkward to carry, so he placed her on his hip like a human 
child, and left through the front door. He stowed the doll in 
his trunk, put the picture of Charlie and her father in the 
visor, and pulled out of Clay’s driveway.

When John got to the library, Jessica was already in 
conversation with the librarian, a middle-aged man with an 
irritated expression. 

“If you want to use the microfiche reader, | need you to 
tell me what you want to look at. Would you like to see the 
index of our archives?” he asked. It sounded like he had 
asked the question several times already. 

“No, that’s all right, | just need to use the machine,” 
Jessica said. The librarian smiled tensely. 

“The reader is for looking at microfilm; what microfilm do 
you want to look at?” he asked very slowly. 

“l brought my own,” Jessica said breezily. 

The librarian sighed. “Do you know how to use the 
machine?” 

“No,” she said after a moment’s thought. 


John stepped forward quickly. “I know how to use it; I’m 
with her. Can you just let us into the room?” 

The librarian nodded wearily, and they followed him to a 
Small back room, where the microfilm reader was set up. 
“You thread the film through here,” he said, “and turn the 
knobs to advance it.” He gave John a suspicious look. “Got 
it?” 

“Yes, thank you for your help. We are very appreciative,” 
John said as he glared at Jessica. 

As the door closed behind the librarian, Jessica pulled the 
film out of her pocket and handed it over. “Okay, what are 
we looking for?” she asked excitedly, clapping her hands 
with anxious energy. 

“Slow down, okay?” John said wearily. “We almost got 
killed, we don’t even know what’s wrong with Charlie, and 
now you’re giddy like we’re looking for hidden treasure.” 

“Sorry.” Jessica straightened her posture. 

“| think these are the same pictures,” John said as he 
unwound the film and threaded it carefully through the 
machine. He flipped it on, and the first picture appeared: 
Jessica and Charlie, picking outfits in a clothing store. He 
clicked through the next few; they all matched what he 
remembered of the photos, though the order was different— 
chronological, he supposed. 

“They're the same, and they’re not any clearer, either,” 
Jessica said. 

“What?” John went back, trying to see what Jessica had 
noticed that he hadn't. 

“They're not any clearer. Charlie is still blurry,” Jessica 
pointed out. 

“She’s just in motion,” John explained. 

“In all of them?” 


“The picture is clear,” he said again, growing agitated. 
“She’s just walking.” Despite his words, he stopped and 
began to go through the pictures more slowly, studying 
Charlie’s appearance in each one. Jessica was right: Charlie 
was blurry in all of the pictures, even some where she 
appeared to be standing still. John clicked through the 
photos fast, confirming it: there was Jessica and Charlie ina 
clothing store; Marla with them outside Jessica’s apartment; 
Charlie hugging herself as she spoke to John at the Burkes’ 
house that first night—Charlie was blurry in all of them. John 
flipped ahead quickly to the last set: himself with Charlie— 
the false Charlie—sitting in the restaurant where they’d had 
dinner. 

The reel ended on the final picture from that night: 
Charlie nearly lost in the crowd, turning back one last time. 
She was barely visible, far more distant here than in any of 
the other pictures, only recognizable by the color of her 
dress and hair. 

“| still don’t see the point,” Jessica said impatiently. John 
grasped the lens and turned it; the picture shrank. “These 
are the same pictures.” She turned away and sighed. 

“This is the point,” he said, slowly turning it back the 
other way. The film was high-resolution and the image 
continued to enlarge as he zoomed closer to Charlie. 

“What is?” 

John kept zooming in; Jessica gasped, stepping back from 
the machine. John let go of the lens. “It has a maximum 
range,” he said softly. The figure that filled the screen was 
elegant and feminine, but it was not human. The face was 
exquisitely sculpted and was split down the middle, a thin 
seam outlining where the two halves met. The limbs and 
body were segmented plates, their color almost iridescent. 


“It looks like a mannequin,” Jessica gasped. 

“Or a clown,” John added. “I saw her,” he said 
wonderingly. “The night Clay was attacked, she was on the 
road. She looked at me...” The eyes in the photo were 
difficult to see, and John leaned closer to the screen, trying 
to make them out. 

“It’s the imposter, it’s the other Charlie,” Jessica 
breathed. John snapped off the projector, blinking as the 
haunting figure disappeared. He took the disc from his 
pocket and handed it to Jessica. She turned it over in her 
hand, her eyes widening. “Is this hers?” 

“No,” John said shortly. “But I’m guessing that our mutual 
friend has one just like it, messing with our heads when 
we’re around her and making us see her as Charlie.” He 
leaned back against the table. “I think Clay took those 
pictures; | think he suspected something like this but 
needed to prove it.” 

“| don’t understand.” 

“These things, these discs, send out signals that 
overwhelm your brain, causing you to not see what’s really 
in front of you. Now, that wouldn’t work on a camera, 
obviously, but Henry thought of that, too.” 

“So, the frequency or whatever it emits causes the image 
to blur,” Jessica said, catching on. 

“Exactly, but it has a maximum range. The signal fades; 
that’s why he captured these from a distance. He suspected 
that whatever was causing the illusion must have its limits.” 
John began putting the film back into his bag. “That’s why 
she looks human in the other pictures, at least, human 
enough when blurred.” 

Jessica studied the disc again for a moment before John 
took it back. “I still don’t understand,” she said. She looked 


around as though suddenly afraid of being caught. 

“| think it’s exactly what | suspected,” he said. “Except | 
was completely wrong.” 

“Oh, that makes perfect sense,” Jessica quipped. 

“| had all these theories about Charlie,” John said. “And 
even though | may have been wrong about the details, | 
suspected that Charlie, our Charlie, had been swapped out 
with an imposter. But it wasn’t a twin brother, or a twin 
sister. Afton swapped her out with ... this.” 

“A robot?” Jessica said skeptically. “Like from Freddy’s? 
John, that was different. People, kids, had been murdered. 
Those robots were haunted. | don’t even believe in 
hauntings, but those things were haunted! Robots like what 
you're talking about don’t exist, at least ... not yet. Plus, she 
knew everything Charlie did, how could Afton have 
programmed that?” 

“She didn’t know everything, though. She blamed all the 
gaps in her memory on the near-death experience; her 
personality changed—everything changed—and we all 
believed she had just turned over a new leaf,” he said 
bitterly. 

“You didn’t,” Jessica said, and he met her eyes. 

“Yeah, but | wanted to. Something just wasn’t right.” 

Jessica was quiet for a moment. “Why did she kill Jen?” 
she said abruptly. 

“What?” 

“Why would she kill Jen?” she repeated. 

“Charlie’s aunt Jen knew her better than anyone,” John 
said. “She must have known she couldn’t fool her.” 

“Yeah, maybe.” Jessica bit her lip, then her face took ona 
look of alarm. “Or she went there—” 

“To find Charlie,” John cut in. 


“John, we left her alone; we have to go back.” 

John was already out the door, running headlong across 
the library to the exit. Jessica ran after him. They both got 
into John’s car and he hit the gas, clenching his jaw as they 
sped toward his apartment. 





Have you forgotten something?” the man snapped, and the 
woman gave him a level stare. 

“| forget nothing.” 

“Then why are you not already on your way?” He lifted 
his arm weakly and gestured toward the door. 

“Time is running short,” she said. “I do not understand 
why we are spending our time— your time—pursuing this 
thing. | am better used here.” 

The man was silent. 

“We are seeing results,” she added, but he shook his 
head. 

“We are seeing nothing.” He held up a finger before she 
could protest. “Anyone can discover a fire already burning, 
but Henry found a unique spark—created something truly 
different, something he didn’t deserve, or intend, to stumble 


upon.” He gave the woman a sharp look. “You will bring it to 
me.” The woman cast her eyes to the floor, and when she 
spoke there was something pleading in her voice. 

“Am | not enough?” she asked softly. 

“No, you’re not,” he said firmly, looking away. 

The woman paused, then walked out the door, not 
looking back.

Neither of them spoke as they sped toward John’s 
apartment. He gripped the wheel until his knuckles turned 
white, trying not to imagine what they might find. 

When he turned into the lot, he let out a shaky breath: 
the few cars belonged to his neighbors, and his door was 
intact. He gave Jessica a curt nod, and they got out of the 
car. Jessica followed close behind and stood beside him, 
facing the parking lot, as he unlocked the door. Jessica 
jabbed him in the side hard with her elbow just as he was 
about to turn the key, and he jerked it back from the lock. 
“OW! What the ... ?” He whirled around angrily to Jessica, 
then immediately straightened his posture and threw ona 
big smile. 

“Charlie!” he blurted. The elegant woman approached 
them, and John reflexively took a step back. “Where did you 
come from? | mean, we didn’t see your car. What a nice 
Surprise,” he added hastily. The woman who was not Charlie 
smiled easily. 

“I’ve been out walking, | wanted to clear my head. | 
realized | was near you and thought I’d stop by. Is that 
okay?” 


John nodded, stalling for time. “Of course! It’s great to 
see you!” John blurted, painfully aware that he was 
overselling. “My place is a mess, though. Bachelor pad, you 
know?” He forced a grin. “Do you and Jessica mind waiting 
out here while | clean up a little?” 

Charlie laughed. “John, you saw my dorm room last year 
—I can handle a little mess!” 

“Well, unlike you last year, I’m not working on a crazy 
brilliant science project, so | have no excuse,” he said. 

Jessica jumped in. “How about that project, Charlie? Did 
you keep working on it? How’s it looking?” 

Charlie turned to Jessica as if seeing her for the first time. 
“I lost interest,” she said. John seized his chance: he 
unlocked the door, slipped inside, and locked it behind him 
before the imposter could follow. In his bedroom, Charlie, his 
Charlie was still curled up on his bed, her back pressed 
against the wall; she didn’t look like she’d moved since he 
left. 

“Charlie,” he whispered. “I’m sorry, but | have to move 
you, now. I'll be careful.” He scooped her up with care. She 
was warm in his arms, and her eyes twitched beneath her 
lids: she was dreaming. John held on tightly, looking around 
the room for a place to hide her—his failure to furnish the 
place beyond the essentials was working against him. John 
carried Charlie out into the living room: the couch was at an 
angle to the wall, leaving a tiny, triangular space behind it. 
John set Charlie on the couch temporarily, took a blanket 
that had been in a heap on the floor, and tossed it down into 
the space, giving her at least a little cushion. Then he 
climbed over, picked her up, and lifted her over the back, 
settling her on the floor. He barely fit, even standing, and he 
kept his eyes behind him as he climbed back over the 


couch, afraid of kicking her. There was another gray blanket 
draped over the end of the couch, something left by a 
previous tenant, and he grabbed it and spread it over 
Charlie, covering her face. 

Someone knocked on the door. “John?” Jessica called. 
“Are you almost done cleaning?” There was an edge of panic 
in her voice. John looked around. There was no evidence of a 
mess, or him having just hurriedly cleaned one. He rushed 
to the bedroom and grabbed some laundry from his laundry 
basket, then carried it with him to answer the door. 

“Sorry,” he said, aiming for a sheepish expression. “| 
don’t get a lot of guests.” Jessica smiled nervously and the 
other Charlie flashed a grin as she pushed in past him. 

“Looks pretty nice,” she said, turning to him. “How’s the 
neighborhood?” 

“... Fine,” John managed, disconcerted to be face-to-face 
with her, moments after the real Charlie. This time he could 
see the differences—he could have written a list. The 
impression that this woman, with her glamorous allure, was 
simply Charlie, grown into her beauty with grace and new 
self-assurance, was gone. Now, the individual features stuck 
out on her face like warts—each one a marker that this was 
not Charlie. Nose too narrow, cheeks too hollow. Eyes too far 
apart. Hairline too high. Eyebrows at the wrong angle. The 
disparities were minute, millimeters or less: the only way to 
be sure would be to look at Charlie and her robotic double 
side by side. Or one right after the other. The imposter 
Charlie gave him a subtle smile and shifted her balance, as 
though about to come closer. John cleared his throat, 
hunting for something to say, but Charlie had already looked 
away and was now glancing around the living room. Behind 
her, Jessica was giving him a questioning look, probably 


wondering where the real Charlie was. John ignored her: 
Not-Charlie strode past him into his bedroom, and he 
followed quickly. 

“Right!” John bolted into action. “So, this is my 
bedroom,” he said, as if the tour had been his own idea. 

“Nice,” Charlie murmured, surveying the room. She 
turned in a circle, taking it all in, then went to the dresser, 
and turned to inspect the room again from there. 

“So, hey, we should all go hang out later or something!” 
Jessica said suddenly, but Charlie didn’t answer. Instead, 
she knelt slowly and peered under the bed. Jessica and John 
exchanged a nervous glance. 

“Not much to see. It’s just me here.” John laughed. 
Jessica elbowed him and made a disapproving expression. 
/’m being too obvious again, he realized. John could feel his 
pulse in his throat, immediately regretting what he’d said. 
Please don’t look around. Charlie went into the bathroom 
and glanced around it, opening the medicine cabinet and 
examining the contents. Jessica gave John a perplexed look, 
then it occurred to her. She’s looking for signs that 
someone’s been injured. Charlie began to close the cabinet, 
then caught sight of her own reflection and paused, her 
hand still on the cabinet door, looking at herself. She was 
still for a long moment, then her eyes darted to John in the 
mirror, and she made a face. 

“| hate mirrors,” she remarked, then turned away and 
pulled back his shower curtain. 

“| know right? They add ten pounds,” John said mildly. 

“Il think that’s cameras,” Jessica corrected. 

“Well, mirrors add at least five,” John whispered. 

“Maybe you just need to lose weight.” 

“Are we really having this conversation now?” 


They continued to watch Charlie. “She’s searching,” 
Jessica whispered. “She’s not even trying to hide it.” 

John worried. Charlie paused and opened the bedroom 
closet, then crouched down to look in the open space under 
his hanging shirts and jackets. She stood and went back into 
the living room: Jessica followed, sprinting to get ahead of 
her and sitting on the couch quickly, crossing her legs. 
Charlie went to the kitchenette and opened the refrigerator, 
then closed it. 

“Are you hungry?” Jessica asked. “I’m sure John has 
something you can eat.” 

“No, thank you. How have you been, Jessica?” Charlie 
asked, crossing the room to the couch. John’s whole body 
went rigid as he willed himself not to run across the room 
and yank her away. Instead, he opened the fridge himself, 
forcing himself to breathe as, from the corner of his eye, he 
watched her sit down beside Jessica. 

“Anybody want a water? Or a soda?” he called. 

“Yes, please,” Jessica said with a strain in her voice, 
coughing loudly. John grabbed two cans and brought them 
over. Jessica took hers eagerly. “Thank you,” she said with 
too much emphasis, and he nodded. 

“Yeah, of course.” He smiled stiffly at Charlie, and she 
looked back: every moment she was there, he felt more and 
more like his skin was about to crawl off his bones. He would 
have thought it was a side effect of her chip, except it had 
not happened until he knew what she was. 

“Sit down, John.” Charlie smiled, gesturing to the arm of 
the couch beside her. 

“Sorry | don’t have chairs and stuff. | never meant to live 
here long-term,” John explained nervously. 


“How long have you been here?” Charlie’s familiar voice 
was like tin. 

John sat down beside her. “Since—everything. This is 
where | lived when | first came here.” 

“Oh.” She glanced around the room again. “I guess | 
don’t remember it.” 

“You never saw it,” he said, unable to keep the coldness 
from his voice. Jessica shot him a warning glance, and he 
took a deep breath. Charlie began scanning the room again. 
She stared straight ahead, her face taking on a look of 
concentration. Her eyes swept up and down the room in 
strokes, her head and torso slowly turning until she was 
looking almost directly behind her: in a second, she would 
see the gap behind the couch. “Charlie, | had fun the other 
night,” John said quickly, forcing himself to mean it. “Do you 
want to have dinner again tonight?” 

She turned back around, looking surprised. “Yes, of 
course—that sounds great, John. Same place?” 

“Same place. Around seven?” 

“Sure.” 

“Great!” Jessica declared, and stood. “Anyway, | have to 
go,” she said. “Want to walk out with me, Charlie?” She 
glanced nervously at John, and he got up quickly. 

“I can give you a ride if you need one,” he volunteered, “1 
know you Said you were walking.” 

Thank you, Jessica mouthed from behind her back. 

“No,” Charlie said. “I think I’ll Keep walking. I’m not 
parked too far away. It’s really nice outside.” 

“Okay, then,” John said. Charlie moved gracefully across 
the living room and let herself out. Jessica let out a long 
breath like she’d been holding it. They went to the window 


and, silently, they watched the imposter go, until she had 
disappeared around a bend in the road. 

“What if she comes back?” Jessica said. “I don’t want you 
alone with that thing,” she finished, practically spitting the 
last word. John nodded in vigorous agreement. 

“| don’t want to be alone with her, either,” he said. 

Jessica looked thoughtful for a moment. “I won’t be gone 
long,” she said. “We need help. And if you don’t think 
Charlie should go to the hospital, then the hospital has to 
come to her.” 

“Marla?” 

“Marla.” And with that, she went to the door quickly. John 
walked out with her, and watched uneasily as Jessica got in 
her car and drove off. Then he went back inside and shut 
the door, locking and bolting it. A /ot of good this will do, he 
thought as he slipped the chain into place. 

“Charlie?” he called softly. He didn’t expect an answer, 
but he wanted—felt almost compelled—to talk to her. 
“Charlie, | wish you could hear me,” he went on, going to 
the bedroom closet and pulling out all two of his other 
blankets. “I think it’s safer for you to stay where you are 
than in the bedroom.” He pulled the couch a little farther 
from the wall, trying to figure out how best to make her 
more comfortable. At a loss, he grabbed a pillow and leaned 
down, reaching to remove the blanket that covered her face. 

“Sorry I’ve only got the one pillow,” he said, trying not to 
lose his balance. 

“’"S okay,” came a muffled murmur from beneath the 
blanket, and John fell back, tumbling over the seat and 
barely catching himself before his head hit the floor. 

“Charlie?” he cried, then lowered his voice as he climbed 
back up. “Charlie, are you awake?” There was no answer. 


This time he did not try to climb into the space behind the 
couch, and bent over to see. She was Stirring, just a little. 
“Charlie, it’s me, John,” he said, his voice hushed, but 
urgent. “If you can hear me, hold on to the sound of my 
voice.” He stopped, as she sat up and pulled the blanket off 
her face. 

He stared down at her, as astonished as the moment 
when he first saw her. Her face was red, and her hair was 
sticking to her skin after being under the blanket; her eyes 
were barely open; she blinked rapidly in the light, looking 
down and away. John leaped up and rushed to shutter the 
front window blinds. He closed the bedroom door and pulled 
the kitchen curtains. The apartment, never bright at its best, 
was nearly dark. He hurried back to Charlie’s hiding place, 
grabbed one end of the couch, and pulled it out farther, 
enough for him to crawl behind with her. She was still 
sitting, leaning against the wall, but she looked limp, like 
she wouldn't be able to do it much longer. He reached out to 
steady her, but when his hand touched her arm she made a 
distressed, high-pitched noise, and he drew back instantly. 
“Sorry. It’s me, John,” he repeated, and she turned her head 
to see him. 

“John,” she said, her voice thin and rasping. “I Know.” Her 
breathing was ragged, and talking seemed to take effort. 
She reached out feebly with one hand. 

“What do you need?” he asked, searching her face. She 
reached out farther and then he understood; he took her 
hand. 

“| won't ever let go of you again,” he whispered. She 
smiled faintly. 

“Could get awkward,” she whispered. She opened her 
mouth as if to go on, then sighed, shuddering. John scooted 


closer, alarmed. 

“What’s—” She took another breath. “Wrong with me?” 
she finished in a rush. She opened her eyes, looking at him 
plaintively. 

“How do you feel?” he asked, avoiding the question. 

“Tired ... everything hurts,” she said haltingly, her eyes 
drifting shut, and he clenched his jaw, trying to keep his 
face neutral. 

“I’m trying to help you,” he said finally. “Look, you have 
to know—there’s someone, something, out here 
impersonating you; saying that she is you.” Her eyes 
Snapped open and she squeezed his hand suddenly: she 
was alert. “She looks just like you. | don’t know why, | don’t 
know what she’s after, but I’m going to find out. And I’m 
going to help you.” 

“Afton,” she breathed, her voice barely audible, and John 
quickly reached over the couch to grab the pillow he’d 
brought. 

“Can you lift your head?” he asked, and she did, slightly, 
letting him slide the pillow into place. “We know it’s Afton,” 
he said, picking up her hand when she was settled again; 
she squeezed it lightly. “I have one of the chips. Afton 
Robotics. Charlie, I’ve got this. Clay’s helping, and Jessica, 
and we’re getting Marla to help you get better. It’s going to 
be okay. Okay?” 

But Charlie had drifted back into unconsciousness; he 
had no idea how much she had heard, or understood. Her 
hand had gone limp in his own. 


* OK OX 


Someone that looks like me ... Never let go ... John? Charlie 
struggled to order her thoughts: things that had made sense 
a moment ago were losing their shape, drifting out of reach 
in a dozen directions like petals on the water. The door... 

“It’s going to be okay,” John said, but she didn’t know if 
he said it in her head or in the world. She felt herself 
slipping back into the dark; she tried to hold on, but the 
exhaustion was weightier than she was, pulling her 
inexorably down with it. 


* OK OX 


Charlie glanced at the door again. He’s /ate, or I’m early. 
She picked up the fork in front of her and ran her thumb 
over the smooth metal; the tines hit her water glass with a 
clear ding! and she smiled at the sound. She hit the glass 
again. How much does he know? 

Charlie struck the glass again, and this time she noticed 
several other patrons turning to look at her in confusion. 
She smiled politely, then set her fork down on the table and 
folded her hands in her lap. Charlie took in a breath and 
composed herself. 


* OK OX 


As John approached the restaurant he could see that Not- 
Charlie was already there. She had changed her clothes. He 
hadn’t really registered what she had been wearing before, 
but now she had on a tight, short red dress—he would have 
remembered that. He stopped on the sidewalk, just out of 
her sight, steeling himself. He couldn’t get the other image 
out of his mind, the painted face with the soldering line 
splitting it down the middle. Charlie was sitting back in her 


chair; there was nothing in front of her but a water glass. 
She had ordered food when they last met here, but John 
couldn’t picture her actually eating it. He couldn’t remember 
noticing her not eating, either. 

“Stop stalling!” came a crackling voice from his waist, 
and he jumped. He extricated the walkie-talkie from his 
jacket pocket and turned away from the restaurant before 
speaking into it, just in case Not-Charlie looked out. 

“I’m not stalling,” he said. 

“You shouldn't be able to hear us,” Jessica’s distorted 
voice reminded him. “Did you tape the button down?” 

“Right, hang on.” John examined the walkie-talkie: The 
tape he had placed over the button to transmit had come 
loose. He replaced it, flattening it down against the uneven 
surface with his fingernail. He slipped the device back in his 
pocket and went inside. 

John glanced briefly around the restaurant as he entered. 
Jessica and Carlton were huddled together in a high-backed 
booth, out of Charlie’s sight. “Can you both still hear me?” 
John whispered. Carlton’s hand raised above the back of the 
booth momentarily with a triumphant thumbs-up, bringing a 
real smile to John’s face. John turned his attention back to 
Charlie, who had not yet noticed him. 

She lifted her head abruptly from the menu as he 
approached the table, as if sensing his presence. She 
flashed him a bright smile. 

“Sorry I’m late,” John said as he sat down. 

“That’s usually my line,” Charlie joked, and he grinned 
uneasily. 

“| guess so.” He looked at her for a moment: he had 
rehearsed things to say, but his mind had gone blank. 


“So, | heard you and Jessica visited that old ghost town.” 
Charlie giggled. “What’s that place called again?” She 
leaned in and rested her chin on her hand again. 

“Ghost town?” John said unevenly, trying to keep his 
expression neutral. It took everything he had not to turn and 
look at Jessica and Carlton behind him. Charlie was looking 
at him expectantly, and he took a sip of water. “You mean 
Silver Reef?” he said, setting down the glass carefully. 

“Yes, | mean Silver Reef.” She was smiling, but her face 
looked tight, like there was something ravenous waiting just 
below the surface. “That’s a strange place to go, John.” She 
cocked her head slightly. “Just out seeing the sights?” 

“I’ve always been a... history buff. The, the gold rush—” 

“Silver,” Charlie corrected. 

“Silver. Yes. That too. Just fascinating times in history.” 
John was tempted to turn and see if Jessica approved of his 
reply or if she was scrambling out of her seat to flee the 
restaurant. “You didn’t know that about me, did you?” He 
straightened his posture. “I love history: historic towns, 
places.” He cleared his throat. 

Charlie picked up her water glass and drank; she set it 
down so he could see the red lipstick mark she left. John 
drew back slightly and looked elsewhere, searching for 
anything he could lock eyes with but her. “Why were you 
there?” Charlie asked, recalling his attention. 

“| was—” he started, then paused, taking a moment to 
gather his thoughts. “I was looking for an old friend,” he 
said, his answer calm. She nodded, then met his eyes. He 
blinked, but forced himself not to look away. He had seen 
eyes like those before: not the madness of Springtrap, or 
the uncanny, living plastic of the other robots, but the stark, 


brutal gaze of a creature bent on survival. Charlie was 
looking at him like he was prey. 

“Did you find your old friend?” she asked, her tone warm, 
and out of place. 

“Yes. | did,” John said, not flinching from her stare. 
Charlie’s eyes narrowed, the facade between them growing 
thinner by the moment. John leaned forward on his crossed 
arms, resting all his weight on the table between them. “1 
found her,” he said in a low voice. There was a brief flare of 
something on Charlie’s face—surprise, maybe, and she 
leaned in closer across the table, mimicking his pose. John 
tried not to flinch as Charlie’s arms slid closer to his. 

“Where is she?” Charlie asked, her tone as soft as John’s. 
Her smile was gone. 

“Il don’t know what it will take to show these people what 
you really are,” John said. “But | can try all sorts of things 
before you make it out that door.” He grasped his soda 
glass, not looking away from her. “I'll start with this glass of 
soda, then I'll try a chair over the back of your head, and 
we'll go from there.” 

Charlie tilted her head, as though taking in his posture. 
He knew his hand was twitching, and his face was red. His 
heart was racing; he could feel his pulse pounding at his 
throat. Charlie smiled, then stood and gently leaned over 
the table. John set his jaw, keeping his eyes fixed on her. 
Charlie kissed his cheek, placing a hand on the side of his 
neck. She kept it there as she moved away, watching his 
eyes. Charlie smiled, her fingers resting on his pulse for a 
scant moment before letting them drift away. John snapped 
back in his seat as if she’d been holding him in place. 

“Thank you for dinner, John,” she said, the words 
sounding almost giddy. She slowly let her hand recoil, as if 


relishing the moment. “It’s always so wonderful to see you.” 
She turned away, not waiting for a response, and went to 
pay the bill. 


* OK OX 


There was a long pause. “She’s gone.” John’s voice came 
over the walkie-talkie. Jessica looked to Carlton; he seemed 
Slightly in shock, staring after Charlie like he’d been 
hypnotized. “Carlton!” Jessica hissed. He snapped out of it, 
Shaking his head. 

“She looks hot!” Carlton said. 

Jessica reared back and slapped Carlton as hard as she 
could. 

“You idiot! You’re supposed to be watching his back, not 
watching her butt! Besides, she put your father in the 
hospital!” 

“No, no, | Know. Very serious ...” He trailed off, obviously 
distracted. 

“Why did | even bring you along?” Jessica scooted out of 
the booth and got to her feet clumsily. 

“Where are you going?” Carlton asked. 

“| have an idea; stay here.” Jessica sighed. “You take my 
Car.” 

Carlton called after, but she didn’t stop to answer, 
merely threw her car keys behind her. Carlton made his way 
over to John’s booth. 

“Hey. Are you okay?” John didn’t turn at the sound of 
Carlton’s voice beside him. 

“No. Not really okay.” John leaned back in his seat, 
looking up at the plaster ceiling, then finally turned to look 
at Carlton. “Where's Jessica?” John asked instantly. 


“I’m not sure, she ran out ...” Carlton gestured toward 
the parking lot, and John turned just in time to see Charlie 
pull out onto the road and drive away. 

“She did something stupid, didn’t she?” John said wearily. 
Carlton met his eyes, then they both ran for the door. 


* OK OX 


Jessica kept low and snuck to the back exit of the 
restaurant; she could see Charlie was still standing at the 
front desk taking care of the bill. Jessica slipped out the 
back door and ran around the perimeter of the building, her 
high heels clacking on the sidewalk. She yanked them off 
and threw them into the bushes, then kept running, 
barefoot. 

“Jessica, what are you doing?” she muttered to herself. 
As she rounded the corner of the building into the parking 
lot, she spotted Charlie’s car and made a beeline for it. The 
front door was unlocked. Jessica quickly popped the trunk, 
shut the door, and slipped inside, not closing the trunk lid all 
the way. 

A minute later there was noise from inside the vehicle, 
and Jessica strained to listen: it sounded like voices. No, a 
voice, she realized after a few minutes. Charlie was talking, 
but there was no one answering her. Jessica concentrated, 
trying to isolate the sounds, but she could make out 
nothing: whatever Charlie was saying, it was unintelligible 
from the trunk. Jessica balanced herself carefully, trying to 
lay as flat as she could while bracing her arm in the air to 
hold the latch of the trunk. If she didn’t hold it tight enough, 
it would visibly bounce and Charlie would notice it. But if 


She pulled it too close, the trunk might shut, and she would 
be trapped. 

After about ten minutes, the car stopped short; Jessica 
was thrown back against the wall, almost losing hold of the 
latch. Regaining her balance, she held very still, listening. 
The driver’s side door opened; then closed a moment later. 
Jessica heard the faint sound of Charlie walking away, 
crunching over gravel, then silence. Jessica sighed in relief, 
but did not move. She began to count: “One Mississippi ... 
two Mississippi ...” she breathed, barely a whisper. There 
was no sound but her own hushed voice as she counted all 
the way to sixty, then stopped and scooted closer to the 
trunk door. She gently eased her grip of the trunk handle, 
letting the hood rise slowly. 

The car was parked in the center of a large parking lot, 
illuminated impossibly bright by streetlamps. The light was 
tinged with red, and Jessica turned to see a large neon sign 
directly overhead, flooding the lot with brilliant reds and 
pinks and blocking her view of anything beyond. The air 
buzzed loudly with the noise of what must have been a 
hundred fluorescent bulbs. Jessica squinted and raised a 
hand to shade her eyes: the enormous, smiling face of a 
little girl stared down at her, glowing neon against the night 
Sky. She was made up to look like a clown: her face was 
painted white, and her cheeks were marked with round, pink 
circles, her nose a matching triangle. Her bright orange hair 
was tied up in two pigtails on either side of her head, and 
beside her were fat, red letters outlined in yellow. Jessica 
peered at the backward sign for a moment before the letters 
made sense: CIRCUS BABY’S PIZZA. The glare of the light began 
to hurt her eyes, and she looked away, then ran toward the 


dark building at the edge of the lot, blinking to get the 
afterimage of the neon sign out of her head. She stumbled 
through a row of hedges to press into a white brick wall, 
which seemed brand-new. She lowered her hand from her 
face, her eyes adjusted to the light, and she saw a long row 
of tall, vertical windows along the face of the wall. 

She went to the nearest one and pressed her face to the 
glass, but the tint was too dark to see even a shadow of 
what lay behind it. Jessica gave up on the windows and 
walked quickly to the back of the building, keeping close to 
the brick wall. The neon whites and reds faded as Jessica 
made her way around back, sinking into darkness. 

There was more parking in the back, though it, too, was 
unoccupied. A single bulb flickered above a plain metal 
door, throwing off a sickly yellow color, which seemed to 
stick to everything. Trash cans lined the wall, and two 
Dumpsters enclosed the small area, shielding the door from 
outside view. Jessica crept toward the door, careful not to 
step on anything. She gave it a gentle pull, but it was sealed 
shut. She balanced against the frame as she pushed herself 
up onto her toes, and grinned. She could see inside. 

Inside was a dimly lit room. Charlie was there: she was in 
profile, talking to someone just beyond Jessica’s view, 
though she could not hear either voice. Jessica inched along 
the ridge, trying to see the other person, but all she could 
make out was the blur of movement as someone gestured. 
After a few minutes, her calves began to ache, and she 
eased herself back down off her toes and flexed her feet. 
She sighed and pushed herself up on her toes again, then 
pressed her face closer, cupping a hand over her eyes to 
block the outside light. It was no use—the room was empty, 
or at least, the light had gone off. Jessica stepped back and 


reluctantly turned to find another place to peer inside—then 
screamed, slapping a hand over her mouth though she was 
too late to stifle the sound. 

Charlie smiled. “Jessica,” she said innocently, “you 
should have told me you were coming here, you could have 
ridden with me.” 

“Right, well, | ran outside to catch you, but you’d already 
left.” Jessica stepped back, her heart racing. Every fiber of 
her being was telling her to run, but she knew she would 
never make it past the imposter who stood before her. 

“Do you want to come in?” Charlie asked, still soeaking 
like they were friends. 

“Yeah, I'd love to; | just couldn’t find the door.” Jessica 
gestured back toward the parking lot. Charlie nodded. 

“It’s on the other side,” she said, taking a step closer. 
Jessica stepped back again. 

“What brings you here, anyway?” Jessica asked, trying to 
sound calm. Does she not know that I know? Will she let me 
leave if 1 play along? 

“! can show you,” Charlie said. Jessica kept her face 
blank; her muscles were so tense they were beginning to 
fatigue, and she breathed in deeply, trying to relax. But 
Jessica was suddenly aware that Charlie was steering her 
closer to a wall where she would be pinned. 

“It’s late, though; | should get going,” Jessica said, 
making herself smile. 

“It’s not late,” Charlie protested, gazing at the sky. 
Jessica hesitated, grasping for an excuse, and Charlie’s eyes 
darted back to Jessica as she took another step forward. She 
was close enough for Jessica to feel her breath on her skin, 
but Charlie was not breathing. 


Charlie smiled broadly, and Jessica drew back, her head 
pressing painfully into the brick wall. Charlie’s smile grew 
wider and wider, elongating impossibly, then suddenly her 
lips were split at the middle as a wide seam appeared, 
bisecting her face from top to bottom. Jessica shrank back, 
curling in on herself instinctually, and as she did Charlie 
seemed to grow taller, her limbs segmenting at the joints 
like a moveable doll. Her features slowly paled and faded 
away, replaced by the iridescent, clown-painted metal face 
they had just been able to make out in Clay’s pictures. 

“Do you like my new look?” Charlie asked, her voice still 
soft and human. Jessica inhaled shudderingly, afraid to 
speak. The creature Charlie had become looked at her 
searchingly. For an instant, an acrid, chemical scent filled 
the air, then Charlie moved swiftly toward Jessica, and the 
world went dark. 





I can't see. 

Jessica closed her eyes and opened them again, but the 
darkness remained. She tried again, realizing with a rising 
panic that she could not move. The air stank of something 
rotten, turning her stomach, and she forced herself to 
breathe deeply. /’// stop noticing it if | breathe. She tried 
again to move, testing to see what was restraining her. She 
was confined in a sitting position: Her wrists were tied 
together behind her, her arms pulled uncomfortably around 
the back of a wooden chair and her ankles bound to its legs. 
She pulled against the restraints, almost tipping the chair 
over as she struggled to free herself, but she could not 
break away. Then there was light. 

Jessica stopped moving. She blinked in the sudden 
brightness, her vision resolving. Charlie’s imposter stood in 


the light of the window, revealed in her true form: She was 
undeniably an animatronic, but she was nothing like any 
other Jessica had ever seen. She was human-size—the same 
size as Charlie—modeled on a human woman, of sorts, her 
bifurcated face painted with rosy cheeks and a bright red 
nose, and her enormous, round eyes were rimmed with 
long, black lashes. She even had hair, two silky orange 
pigtails sprouting from the sides of her head, gleaming 
unnaturally in the light—Jessica couldn’t tell what her hair 
was made of. She was wearing a red-and-white costume—or 
rather the metal segments of her body were painted to look 
like a costume; at her waist, a red skirt stuck out playfully. 
She was standing very still, and she was staring straight at 
Jessica. Jessica froze, afraid to breathe, but the creature just 
tilted her metal head to the side, watching. Her animatronic 
face looked familiar, but she still felt fuzzy and couldn’t 
recall where she’d seen it. 

“| don’t suppose you’d give me a hand with these?” 
Jessica lifted her feet the quarter inch the restraints would 
allow. The animatronic smiled. 

“No, | don’t suppose | would,” she said, her voice 
alarmingly unchanged. Jessica shrank back, revolted at the 
sound of her friend’s voice coming from this singular new 
creature. 

“Who are you?” Jessica asked. 

“I’m Charlie.” 

Jessica looked around the dimly lit room helplessly. Apart 
from the chair, the only object she could see was a gigantic, 
old-fashioned coal-burning furnace, with a warm orange 
glow emanating from the thin vents in its door. 

“At least,” the creature began, “part of me is Charlie.” 
She held her hand out in front of her, studying it. Jessica 


looked up and suddenly it was Charlie standing in the light 
of the window, looking confused and innocent. “It’s 
strange,” the animatronic said. “| have these memories. | 
know they don’t belong to me; and yet at the same time, 
they do.” She paused, and Jessica returned to wrestling with 
the knots. “I know that they don’t belong to me because | 
don’t fee/ anything when they come to mind. They are just 
there, like a long road you walk on, lined with billboards of 
things happening somewhere else.” 

“Well, what do you feel?” Jessica muttered, trying to drag 
out the conversation as her survival instincts kicked in. 

The animatronic girl’s eyes darted toward her. “I feel ... 
disappointment,” she said, her voice growing more tense. 
“Desperation.” She looked out the window. “A father’s 
disappointment, and a daughter’s desperation,” she 
whispered. 

“Henry?” Jessica gasped. The girl looked back at her. 

“No. Not Henry. He was more brilliant than Henry. | 
watched my father work from a distance, a great, great, 
distance.” Her voice trailed off. Jessica waited for her to go 
on, half forgetting that she was trying to escape. “I see 
everything clearly now,” the animatronic continued. “But in 
my memories ... things were much simpler, which made it 
SO much more painful. Now | know that people are all 
fading, fragile, inconsequential. But when you are a child, 
your parents are everything: They are your world, and you 
don’t know anything else. When you are a little girl, your 
father is your world. How tragic and miserable such an 
existence is.” Jessica felt a wave of dizziness and looked up 
to see that the animatronic now appeared as the clown 
again, but the image passed. Suddenly, it was Charlie in the 
light, but the moment’s disruption in the illusion was 


enough to remind Jessica of where she was—and that she 
had to get away. 

The animatronic girl stood beside the only window in the 
room. There was a door nearby; she was closer to it than 
the animatronic, not that she could count on outrunning her. 
What else am | going to try? Tentatively, keeping her eyes 
fixed on her captor, Jessica started working her wrists back 
and forth, trying to loosen the rope that held her. The girl 
watched, but did not move to stop her, so Jessica kept 
going. 

“That’s the flaw, and the greatest sin of humanity,” the 
girl said. “You are born with none of your intelligence, but all 
of your heart, fully capable of feeling pain, and torment, but 
with no power to understand. It opens you up to abuse, to 
neglect, to unimaginable pain. All you can do is feel.” She 
studied her hands again. “All you can do is feel, but never 
understand. What a sick power it is that you are given.” 

The ropes only seemed to tighten as Jessica pulled at 
them, and Jessica felt tears of frustration pricking at her 
eyes. No wonder she doesn't care if | try to escape, she 
thought bitterly. /f / could just see the knots ... She stopped 
moving and took a deep breath, then closed her eyes. Find 
the knot. Ignore the robot. Jessica fumbled with her right 
hand, searching for the end of the knot, bending her wrist 
painfully. At last, she found the end of the rope and grasped 
it: the rope tightened, but she inched her fingers along until 
she came to the base of the knot, then began to carefully 
push the end of the rope up through the final loop. 

“! wanted so desperately to have been the one on that 
stage, but it was always her. All of his love went into her.” 

“You're talking about Afton.” Jessica stopped, and Charlie 
nodded confirmation. “William Afton never made anything 


with love,” Jessica snarled. 

“| should rip you in half.” Charlie’s appearance flashed, 
the animatronic’s face and body seeming to break, then 
reassemble in an instant. For a moment her expression 
wavered, a vulnerability showing on her face, but she 
quickly collected herself. “She was his obsession.” 

The animatronic twisted her hair around her fingers. “He 
worked on her day and night, the clown baby with bright 
orange pigtails. Petite enough to be sweet and 
approachable, but large enough to swallow you whole.” She 
laughed. 

Jessica pulled the rope a last time: She had managed to 
undo the first knot. Breathing heavily with the effort, Jessica 
opened her eyes: The animatronic had not moved from the 
window—she seemed still to be watching with a kind of 
amused interest. Jessica gritted her teeth and closed her 
eyes, and started on the next knot. 

“| wanted to be her,” the girl whispered. “The focus of his 
attention, the center of his world.” 

“You're delusional.” Jessica snickered as she struggled 
with the rope, trying to keep her distracted. “You’re a robot; 
you're not his child.” 

The animatronic pulled a chair away from the wall, and 
sat with a pained expression. “One night | snuck out of bed 
to see her. I’d been told not to a hundred times. | pulled the 
sheet away. She was gleaming bright, beautiful, standing 
over me. She had happy red cheeks and a lovely red dress.” 

Jessica paused in her work, confused. Who is she talking 
about? 

“It’s odd, because | remember looking down at the little 
girl as well. It’s strange seeing through both sets of eyes 
now. But as | said, one is no more than a data tape, a record 


of my first capture, my first kill.” The animatronic’s eyes 
flared bright in the darkness. “The little girl approached me 
and pulled the sheet away. | felt nothing; it’s no more than a 
record of what happened. But there /s feeling, my feeling as 
| pulled the sheet away, and stood in awe before this 
creature my father loved, this daughter he had made for 
himself. The daughter who was better than me, the 
daughter he wished | had been. | wanted to be her, so 
badly.” Charlie’s appearance faded, revealing the painted 
clown, and Jessica sighed as a wave of nausea and dizziness 
passed over her again. “So, | did what | was built to do,” the 
girl said, and stopped talking. The room was silent. 

When the last knot slipped loose and the rope fell to the 
floor, Jessica’s eyes popped open in surprise. She leaned 
forward, moving her numb, tingling arms down to her ankles 
as she watched the girl, who simply continued to observe 
her. Jessica undid the knots that held her ankles quickly— 
they were looser, done carelessly, and she put her feet flat 
on the floor, her stomach fluttering. Time to run. 

Jessica ran for the door, propelling her wobbly knees and 
sore ankles through sheer force of will. There was no sound 
from behind her. She’s going to be right behind me! she 
thought wildly as she reached the door and turned the knob. 
She yanked it open with overflowing relief—and screamed. 

Close enough to touch was a mottled face, swollen and 
misshapen. The skin looked too thin, and the bloodshot 
eyes, staring angrily at her, quivered as if they were about 
to burst. Jessica jerked away, stumbling back into the room. 
Her eyes darted to his neck, where two rusting lengths of 
metal protruded from his skin. He stank of mold: the furry 
suit he wore was covered in it, turning the cloth green, 


though as Jessica took in the whole of him, she knew it had 
once been yellow. 

“Springtrap,” she breathed, her voice shaky, and his lips 
twitched into something that might have been a smile. 
Jessica ran to the chair she’d been tied to, putting it 
between them as if it would do any good, then horribly, 
Springtrap began to laugh. Jessica tensed, grasping the 
chair’s wooden back, ready to defend herself, but Springtrap 
just kept laughing, not moving from the spot where he 
stood. He cackled on and on, rising to an impossible pitch, 
then he broke off abruptly, his eyes snapping to Jessica. He 
shuffled closer, then, inexplicably, he began to caper ina 
grotesque dance as he sang in a thin, unsteady voice. 

Oh, Jessica’s been caught 

Oh, Jessica she fought 

But now she’s going to die! 

Oh my! 

Jessica glanced at the animatronic girl in the corner, who 
looked away as though disgusted. Springtrap danced closer, 
circling Jessica as he repeated the verse, and she hefted the 
chair between them, watching for a chance to strike. Jessica 
tripped over her own feet trying to get out of his way. Even 
for him, this ts insane. He danced closer and away, the 
words he sang degenerating into syllables of nonsense, 
interrupted by maniacal laughter. Jessica held the chair 
steady, ready to swing it. Suddenly, Springtrap froze in 
place. 

Jessica’s arms wavered, and she set the chair down with 
a thud. Springtrap didn’t move, even his face was 
completely motionless. Like someone turned him off. She 
had barely finished the thought when his whole body went 
limp, collapsing on the floor with a clatter. He flickered, then 


Springtrap faded away, leaving in his place a blank, 
segmented doll. Jessica whirled to look at the animatronic 
girl: she was still watching without expression. 

“Enough theatrics.” A rasping male voice came from the 
open door. “Jessica, isn’t it?” The voiced wheezed. She 
squinted, unable to make out anything in the dim light. 

“| know that voice,” she said slowly. There was a whirring 
sound coming from the doorway, and soon Jessica could see 
something roll into the room, an automated wheelchair of 
some sort. He was dressed in what looked like white silk 
pajamas and a black robe of the same cloth, covering him 
from chin to toe, black leather slippers on his feet. Behind 
him, three IV bags hung from a wheeled stand, the tubes 
extending up under the sleeve of his pajama shirt. His head 
was bald, covered in ridged pink scars. Where there were no 
scars, there were strange pallets of plastic, molding, and 
metal, pressed into his head as though fused to it. He 
turned his head slightly and Jessica saw that while one eye 
was perfectly normal, the other was simply missing: the 
gaping socket was dark, and shot through with a thin steel 
rod that glinted in the light. He was painfully thin, the bones 
of his face visible, and as he gave Jessica a small, twisted 
smile, she saw tendons move like snakes beneath the 
surface of his skin. She had to fight to keep from retching. 

“Do you know who | am?” he asked. 

You're William Afton, Jessica thought, but she shook her 
head, and he sighed, a rattling sound. 

“Come here,” he said. 

“I'll stay where | am,” she said tightly. 

“As you like.” He shifted his weight carefully, the 
wheelchair letting out a whir as it moved forward slowly. The 
animatronic girl started toward him and he waved her off, 


but the gesture threw off his balance, and fora moment he 
appeared as though he might fall to the side, but he gripped 
the arm of the chair with a pained expression, righting 
himself. 

“So what was the dance routine for?” Jessica asked 
loudly, and he looked at her as though surprised she was 
still there. Then, he raised his hands to the knot on his robe, 
his fingers struggling clumsily to undo it. 

“| thought you might like to see me as | was. A familiar 
face,” he said, and smirked. He held up a small disc in his 
hand and clicked it on. The blank doll on the floor suddenly 
looked as it had a moment ago, with the bloodied, duplicate 
William Afton stuffed inside the rabbit suit. 

“Time changes all things,” he went on, clicking the disc 
off again. “As does pain. When | called myself Springtrap | 
was ecstatic with power, delirious over my newfound 
strength. But pain changes all things, as does time.” He 
opened his robe to reveal his torso. 

At the center of his chest was a mass of twisted flesh, 
crossed with neat, diagonal lines of black stitching thread; 
rippling out from the wound were the marks of the spring- 
lock suit, some scarred over years before, and some 
scarcely healed, the skin a shiny, angry red. He raised a 
hand to the wad of stitches, careful not to touch it. “Your 
friend inflicted this new wound,” he said mildly, then bent 
his head slightly forward, calling her attention to his neck. 
She took an involuntary step closer, and gasped. 

His skin was gone, she thought at first, the innards of his 
neck laid open to the air. But the blood ... he’d be dead. 
Jessica took a long, slow breath, feeling light-headed as she 
tried to make sense of what she saw. The wound had been 
covered with something else, plastic, maybe: she could see 


where the surrounding skin had fused to it, healing red and 
ugly. Through the clear material, whatever it was, she could 
see his throat—she didn’t know enough about anatomy to 
name the parts, but they were red and blue, blocks of 
muscle and strings of veins or tendons. Wedged in among 
them were things that never belonged inside a human body; 
Small scraps of metal, embedded in the tissue. There were 
too many to count. The man moved, and they glinted in the 
light. Jessica gasped, and he wheezed, clearly struggling to 
breathe with his neck turned the way it was. Something 
caught her eye as he moved, and she leaned in closer: she 
was almost touching him now, and the smell was awful: a 
noxious perfume of disinfectant. She peered through the 
clear shield and saw it: a spring, its coils wrapped tightly 
around what looked like three veins, the sharp ends plunged 
deep into red muscle tissue. 

Jessica stepped back and almost tripped on the fallen 
mannequin that had been Springtrap. She kicked away the 
jumble of limbs, recovering her balance, and looked into the 
man’s mutilated face again. 

“Yeah, | Know you. Didn’t you used to be a mall guard?” 
she said. His fists clenched, and his eyes darkened with fury. 

“Spare me. Dave the guard was a character, one 
concocted on a moment’s notice to play you for a fool, you 
and your friends. It was insulting. It doesn’t take a great 
thespian to pretend to be an idiot night guard, as long as 
you can get around inconspicuously. | have not been 
inconspicuous for some time. It hardly matters now anyway, 
as this is all that’s left of me.” His voice gargled with 
despair. 

“Come sit with me, Jessica.” The animatronic girl dragged 
his IV stand with one hand, helping him back to a corner, 


where more medical devices and a reclining chair awaited. 
Jessica eyed the door, bracing herself to move, when the 
quiet was broken by what sounded like a child’s scream in 
the distance. 

“What was that?” Jessica said. “That sounded like a kid.” 

The man ignored her and settled back into the furnished 
chair. The animatronic girl busied herself with the machines 
around him, attaching electrodes to his bare scalp and 
checking the IV bags. A monitor began to beep at slightly 
irregular intervals, and he waved his hand. “Turn that off. | 
can’t stand the sound of it. Jessica, come closer.” 

Stay alive. Play along, Jessica thought to herself as she 
warily picked up the chair she’d been tied to, carried it over 
to the man, and sat. Jessica trained her eyes on the 
animatronic girl as she strode across the room, gripped a 
handle, and pulled a long table straight out of the wall as if 
they were going to view a body in a morgue. Jessica clasped 
her hand over her mouth as fumes of oil and burning flesh 
washed over her. There was something lying on the table, 
covered with a plastic sheet. 

Jessica leaped up again and backed away. “What is this? 
Who did you murder now?” she demanded. 

“No one new,” William spurted, almost as though he was 
trying to laugh. The plastic crinkled; something was moving 
inside. 

“What have you done?” Jessica gasped. 

The animatronic girl took a cotton ball from a bag 
nearby, wetted it from the bottle in her hand, and wiped it 
thoroughly up and down the metal fingers of one hand, then 
dropped it into a trash can at her feet. She took another 
piece of cotton and repeated the process, continuing over 
the surface of her hands and forearms up to her elbows. 


She’s sterilizing herself. Jessica turned to the man in the 
chair, keeping the girl in her peripheral gaze. Behind him 
the animatronic girl was sterilizing a scalpel, using the same 
care she had taken with her hands. 

“Here | thought you’d cheated death,” Jessica said, 
almost feeling sorry for him. 

“Oh, believe me, | have. You have only seen one fraction 
of what was done to me, the shrapnel that even dozens of 
surgeries—and | have had dozens—could not remove.” He 
Slowly rolled up the sleeve of his pajama shirt, revealing two 
staves of metal embedded in his arm, both dotted with 
ragged pieces of gray rubber. “Parts of that costume have 
become part of me.” The animatronic girl took what looked 
like a pair of scissors out of the drawer and began to swab 
them clean, dabbing gently along every surface. 

“But the fake blood.” Jessica closed her eyes, shaking her 
head. Charlie said that Clay found fake blood at Freddy’s. 
“There was fake blood; you faked your death.” 

Afton coughed, and his eyes widened. “I assure you, | 
didn’t fake anything. If your police friend found fake blood 
...” He took a steadying breath. “It wasn’t mine. | bleed, just 
like everyone else.” He finished, and smiled, giving Jessica a 
moment to think before continuing. 

“| gave you a monster.” He gestured toward the 
collapsed doll that had been Springtrap. “But | assure you, 
I’m very, miserably, human.” He paused again, a surge of 
anger crossing his face. 

“My scalp was torn from my head when | escaped that 
costume, all but this piece here.” He touched the small 
patch where hair still grew. “Scraps of metal are interwoven 
through every part of my body that has not been replaced 


with artificial tissue. Every movement causes me 
unimaginable pain. Not moving is even worse.” 

“I’m not going to feel sorry for you,” Jessica said 
suddenly, braver than she felt. Afton took a breath and 
stared at her blankly. 

“Do you believe that your pity will make any difference 
concerning what | do to you?” he asked with a steady tone. 
He tilted his head, leaning back as if taking a moment to 
relish the words, then his face lost the glint of cunning. “1 
am simply telling you, so that you can help with what comes 
next,” he said tiredly. Jessica stood. 

“You want me to be impressed by how much you've 
survived, and how much pain you’re in. | don’t care about 
you.” She approached William’s chair, then crossed her 
arms, glaring down at him from above. She glanced at the 
animatronic girl, who seemed poised to intervene, a half- 
swabbed scalpel in her hand, but Afton gave a subtle shake 
of his hand toward her, waving her off, seeming to enjoy the 
exchange. Jessica bent closer. 

“William Afton,” she said. “There is nothing in this world 
that | care less about than your pain.” 

Another child’s scream came from somewhere nearby, 
and Jessica straightened. 

“That was a little kid,” Jessica said, a heady rush of 
adrenaline surging through her. She felt suddenly forceful, 
like she had some control of the situation. “You’re the one 
who’s been kidnapping those kids, aren’t you?” she 
demanded, and Afton smiled weakly. 

“I’m afraid those days are gone for me.” He laughed, and 
looked fondly at the animatronic girl, who looked up at 
Jessica and smiled delicately. The girl straightened her 
posture and continued to stare; Jessica took a step back. All 


at once, the girl’s stomach split open at the middle and out 
shot an enormous mass of wires and prongs. It reached its 
full extension and snapped open and shut with a steely 
clank. Jessica screamed, jumping back. The thing fell to the 
ground, then slowly recoiled back into the girl’s stomach, 
which closed seamlessly. She smiled at Jessica, running her 
finger up and down the now-invisible line of the opening. 
Jessica averted her eyes. 

“Baby, that’s enough,” Afton whispered. Jessica came to 
attention, her panic suddenly washed over with confusion. 
She looked from the girl to Afton, and back again. 

“Circus Baby,” she said, suddenly recalling the sign 
outside the restaurant. The animatronic girl smiled wider, 
her face threatening to split in half. “You’re not as cute as 
you are on the sign,” Jessica said bitingly, and the girl 
stopped smiling instantly, turning her body toward Jessica 
like she was aiming a weapon. A high-pitched ringing rose 
all around them, and Jessica edged backward. That’s her 
chip, Jessica thought, bracing as if for impact. The 
animatronic girl held out her arms as though in a gesture of 
welcome. 

Thin, sharp spines like porcupine’s needles began to 
grow from her metal skin, each capped with a red knob like 
a pinhead, spaced a few inches apart, and extending from 
her face, her body, and her arms and legs. They grew slowly 
outward, lining up perfectly with one another to create a 
false contour all around her body. The girl looked 
expectantly at Jessica. 

“Give it a minute,” the girl said. “Let your eyes adjust.” 
The humming sound grew louder, rising higher in pitch 
until it became painful to hear. Jessica covered her ears, but 
it did nothing to dampen the sound. Suddenly, a new image 


Snapped into place: where the smooth, slim redheaded 
animatronic had been was a gigantic, cartoonish child, her 
green eyes too large for her face, and her nose and cheeks 
painted a garish pink; she was a perfect image of the girl on 
the neon sign. Before Jessica could react, the childish image 
vanished, the needlelike extensions snapping back into the 
girl’s body with a metallic snap. The humming stopped. The 
animatronic girl had returned to her former appearance. 
William Afton watched her with a gleam of pride. 

Jessica turned again to the sleek, shiny girl standing at 
the man’s side. “How did you create her?” Jessica asked, her 
eyes filled with curiosity for a moment before snapping 
herself back to the immediate danger surrounding her. 

“Ah. A woman with a mind for science. You can’t help but 
to admire what I’ve done.” He braced himself on one arm of 
the chair, hoisting himself up to sit straighter. “Although ...” 
He looked up at the gleaming girl for a moment, then turned 
away. “I can’t take complete credit for this, unfortunately.” 
He reclined his head again and let out a sigh. “Sometimes 
great things come at a great cost.” 

Jessica waited for him to go on, confused, then looked at 
the animatronic girl, recalling all that she’d said minutes 
before. 

“Lam a brilliant man, make no mistake. But what you see 
before you is a combination of all sorts of machinations and 
magic. My only real accomplishment was making something 
that could walk.” He reached out and tapped the leg of the 
animatronic standing at his side; she did not react. “No 
small accomplishment. Although it’s not happening as 
fluidly as you think. A lot of what you see is just in your 
head.” He wheezed a laugh, then stopped himself, ending 
with a pained cough before going on. “That was Henry’s 


idea not to try to reinvent the wheel. Why try to create the 
illusion of life, when your mind can do it for us?” 

“She’s more than an illusion, though,” Jessica said 
plainly. 

“Quite right,” Afton answered thoughtfully. “Quite right. 
But that’s why we're here—to discover the secret of that 
last ingredient, what you might call the spark of life.” 

“Is that why I’m here, too?” Jessica clenched her jaw. 

“| believe you came here of your own free will, didn’t 
you?” Afton said mildly. 

“I didn’t tie myself up.” 

“But | certainly didn’t put you in the trunk of that car,” he 
answered. 

“We would rather have had your friend Charlie,” he 
continued. “But we can find a use for you.” He closed his 
eyes for a long moment, then opened them, meeting 
Jessica’s eyes. “I have faced my own mortality, Jessica. | 
knew | was dying and through every broken fragment of my 
body, | was profoundly, immeasurably afraid. | fear it more 
than | fear life like this, even when every waking instant is 
pain, and sleep is possible only when induced by enough 
medication to kill most people.” 

“Everyone is afraid to die,” Jessica said. “And you should 
be more afraid than anyone else, because if there’s a hell, 
there’s a hole at the bottom of it reserved for you.” 

Afton nodded with a moment of honest resignation. “In 
time, I’m sure that’s where | will find myself. But the devil 
has knocked on my door before, and I’ve turned him away.” 
He smiled. 

“So, what? You want to live forever?” 

William Afton smiled sadly and held out his hand to the 
animatronic girl; she went to him and put a protective hand 


on his shoulder. “Certainly not like this,” he said. Jessica 
glanced at the robot girl, then back to the man in front of 
her, his body already riddled with mechanical parts. 

“So, what, you’re making yourself into a robot?” She 
laughed nervously, then stopped at his grave expression. “| 
didn’t realize that you fancied yourself a mad scientist.” 

“No, that’s science fiction,” he said, unamused. 

The plastic tarp moved again, and began to slide off the 
table, but stopped, not revealing what lay underneath. 

“Everyone dies.” Jessica blinked; the adrenaline was 
wearing off, and she was beginning to feel exhausted. Afton 
reached up and touched the mechanical girl’s cheek, then 
turned his attention back to Jessica. 

“The most terrible accidents sometimes bear the most 
beautiful fruits,” he said, as if to himself. “Re-creating the 
accident—that is the duty and the honor of science. To 
replicate the experiment, and obtain the same result. | give 
my life to this experiment, piece by piece.” He nodded at 
the girl, and she approached Jessica with deliberate steps. 
Jessica backed away, fear surging again. 

“What are you going to do to me?” She could hear the 
urgency in her own voice. 

“Please, enough. As a woman of science, at least try to 
appreciate what I’ve done,” Afton said. 

“I study archaeology,” she said in a flat tone. He didn’t 
respond; the girl stepped closer, giving her an unreadable 
stare. 

The plastic tarp slid from the table, and Jessica startled 
and stared at what was underneath, but her terror turned to 
confusion in an instant. There wasn’t a body, not human or 
machine. Instead there was a melted scrapheap, whose 
extensions could be interpreted as arms and legs, but with 


no defined mechanism of movement. There were no joints, 
no muscles, no skin or coverings, just masses of undefined 
tangles and cords, melted into one another and fused 
together. Most of it seemed fused to the table, burned and 
blackened at the edges where it touched the table itself, 
melting into it and seemingly inseparable from it. 

“| don’t understand.” Jessica’s mouth hung open, and she 
sat down again without thinking. 

“Good girl.” Afton smiled thinly. Jessica clenched her jaw. 
The animatronic girl went back to the table and took up the 
cotton balls and rubbing alcohol. She started with her 
fingers again, methodically wiping down each one. “Get on 
with it,” Afton said impatiently. The girl did not break her 
deliberate pace. 

“| touched you; | have to start over,” she said. 

“Nonsense, just do it. I’ve survived worse than this.” 

“The risk of infection ...” she said calmly. 

“Elizabeth!” he snapped. “Do as | say.” The animatronic 
girl stopped moving at once, looking startled, and for a 
moment almost seemed to tremble. Jessica held her breath, 
wondering if anyone knew, or cared, that she had just heard 
the exchange. The girl immediately regained her 
composure, her eyes relaxing, then opened the drawer and 
took out a pair of rubber gloves, which she fitted easily over 
her metal hands. He settled back, and the girl came to him 
and bent over to press a button on the side of his chair. The 
chair made a pneumatic hiss and reclined, flattening out like 
a bed, and the girl placed her foot on a lever at the chair’s 
base. She stepped on it, and the chair jerked upward. Afton 
made a pained grunt, and Jessica winced reflexively. The girl 
hit the lever again, yanking the chair up another inch, then 
stopped and flipped the monitor back on. It began to beep 


again at slightly irregular intervals, and she levered the 
chair up rapidly, jolting Afton’s frail body as it rose. The girl 
darted her eyes from the monitor to Afton and back again, 
attentive to his vital signs. When the chair reached waist- 
height, she stepped back, apparently satisfied. Afton let out 
a rattling breath, then lifted his hand an inch to point at 
Jessica. 

“Come closer,” he said. She took a small step, and he 
curled his lips in a smile or a sneer. “I want you to watch 
what happens next,” he said. 

“What's going to happen next?” Jessica asked, hearing 
her own voice shake. 

“How did the creatures at Freddy’s move, of their own 
will, with no outside force controlling them?” he asked 
mildly. He tilted his head, waiting. 

“The children were still inside. Their souls were inside 
those creatures,” she said, the words brittle. She fe/t brittle, 
like if anything touched her now, she might easily break 
apart. 

Afton sneered again. 

“Oh, Jessica, come now. What else?” She closed her eyes. 
What is he talking about? “What else was inside them, to 
bind their spirits so inseparably to the bear, to the rabbit, to 
the fox? How did they die, Jessica?” 

Jessica gasped, covering her mouth with both hands, as if 
she could stop herself from knowing, as long as she did not 
speak. “How, Jessica?” Afton demanded, and she lowered 
her hands, trying to steady her breath. 

“You killed them,” she said, and he made an impatient 
sound. She met his eyes again, not flinching from the empty 
socket. “They died in the suits,” she said hoarsely. “Their 
bodies were bound inside, along with their souls.” 


He nodded. “The spirit follows the flesh, it would seem, 
and also the pain. If | wish to become my own immortal 
creation, my body must lead my spirit to its eternal home. 
Since | am still ... experimenting ... | move my flesh piece by 
piece.” He looked thoughtfully over at the creature on the 
table. “More and more,” he murmured, almost to himself, “it 
is a test of the strength of my own will. How much of myself 
can | carve away, and still remain in control?” 

“Carve away?” Jessica repeated faintly, and he snapped 
his attention back to her. 

“Yes. | will even allow you to watch,” he said with a 
smirk. 

“No, thanks,” she said, shrinking back, and he wheezed a 
laugh. 

“You will watch,” he said, then gestured to the 
animatronic girl. “Keep an eye on her,” Afton said. 

“| have many eyes on her.” The girl went to a cabinet 
and took out another IV bag: before she closed the door, 
Jessica caught a glimpse of more like it, and a shelf of what 
looked like vacuum-sealed cuts of meat. Her stomach 
flipped, and she swallowed hard. 

Jessica started to squirm in her seat; there was a hissing 
sound coming from somewhere, and a smell of burning oil 
began to fill the room. The table where the mass of metal 
rested was beginning to glow orange at its center, and the 
mass on the table seemed to move slightly, although only 
out of the corner of Jessica’s eye. Jessica snapped back to 
attention and turned toward Afton. 

He appeared to be asleep: his chest rose and fell with 
slow breaths, and his eyes were closed; his eyelid draped 
loosely over the steel rod in the center of his missing eye, 
the thin skin hanging into the empty socket. The girl 


nodded, and moved to the table. Jessica swallowed, the 
rotten smell swelling around her. She had ceased to notice 
it, her nose tuning it out, but now it was everywhere, 
thickening the air with its miasma. An operating theater ... 
he’s harvesting the kids for organs, transplanting them into 
himself? 

Jessica looked around the room, calculating—the scalpels 
were too far away to grab, and they wouldn’t even scratch 
the animatronic girl’s paint. If she ran, she would be dead 
before she was halfway to the door. Jessica forced herself to 
watch. 

The animatronic girl went to William Afton’s side, then 
checked the monitor again with care. She unbuttoned his 
pajama top and splayed it open, revealing his chest, and the 
mass of scars that had covered it since before he went by 
the name “Dave.” The girl tugged the waist of his pants an 
inch lower, so that his torso was fully exposed, then nodded, 
took off her gloves, and replaced them with new ones. Then 
she took up one of the scalpels. Jessica looked away. 

“You have to watch,” the girl said, her voice chilling, a 
human voice stripped of human intonation. Jessica jerked 
her head up; the animatronic’s eyes were on her. “He wants 
to see you watch,” she repeated, the pleasant veneer 
cloaking her voice once more. Jessica gulped, and nodded, 
fixing her eyes on the scene before her. “I don’t think you 
understand,” the girl said. “Go wash your hands.” 

Shakily, Jessica got to her feet and went to the sink, 
feeling as if she might pass out at any moment. She turned 
the sink on and watched the water spiral down the drain, 
the shiny stainless steel gleaming through in the bright 
light. 


“Wash your hands.” Jessica obeyed, pushing up her 
Sleeves above her elbows and washing her hands all the 
way up the forearms, foaming up the soap over and over as 
she had seen doctors do on TV. She rinsed them finally and 
turned to the animatronic girl. 

“What am | doing?” she asked. The girl ripped open a 
plastic package and took out a towel. She held it out to 
Jessica. 

“You're going to help.” 

Jessica took the towel and dried her hands, then put on 
gloves from the box the animatronic girl directed her to. 
“You know this thing isn’t sterile, right?” she muttered, 
glancing at the mass on the table. 

“Wait.” Jessica gasped and took a step toward the table. 
From this angle, she could see more of its form. It was a 
melted mess, but she could recognize certain elements in 
the mass of fused scrap on the table. A /eg. A finger. An... 
eye socket. 

“I—I recognize these parts,” Jessica said, but there was 
no answer. “These look like ... endoskeletons, from Freddy’s, 
the original Freddy’s.” Jessica began calculating in her head, 
measuring to herself how much this mass must weigh, and 
its size relative to the size of the endoskeletons she 
remembered. Before she could think further, the creature on 
the table attempted to lift its leg, the makeshift knee 
bending partially. There was no mechanical device that she 
could make out—it seemed to be moving of its own will. 
After a second, it dropped back to the table. 

“Where did you find these?” Jessica stepped back. 
“Where did you find these? What did you do? Why did you 
... melt them all together?” 


“Hand me the scalpel,” the girl said patiently. The 
Surgical implements were laid out in a neat row on the 
rolling table, on a piece of paper, along with a set of curved 
needles, already threaded, and a small, kitchen-size 
propylene torch. The creature on the table tried again to lift 
its leg, and suddenly Jessica understood how it was able to 
move. 

“They’re still in there!” Jessica screamed. “The children— 
Michael!” The creature writhed pitifully, as if responding to 
her voice, and Jessica’s heart wrenched. They’re in there, 
and they’re in pain. 

“Il guess | should have kidnapped Marla if | wanted a 
nurse,” the girl said sardonically. “I told you, he wants you 
to watch. Look over here.” Jessica obeyed, feeling her head 
go light as the girl pressed the scalpel into Afton’s skin. 
Don’t pass out. She drew the blade across his lower 
abdomen with steady, practiced hands, making a six-inch 
incision. She held out the scalpel, and Jessica stared fora 
moment before realizing she was supposed to take it. “He 
wants you to watch; it’s the only reason you’re alive. If you 
don’t watch, then there is no reason for you to be here. Do 
you understand?” Jessica steadied herself. Breathe. Don’t 
faint. Think about something else. 

John, Charlie—no, I'll start crying. Something else, 
something else ... 

Shoes. Black boots, knee high. The kind that look like 
riding boots. Italian leather. Jessica took the scalpel and set 
it down where it had been, and the blood dripped onto the 
paper, seeping into the fibers. Jessica took another deep 
breath. 

The animatronic girl had one of her hands inside the 
incision, and was pulling it back, peering into the wound she 


had just made. “Scalpel,” she said again, and Jessica picked 
up a new one and handed it to her. “Watch,” the girl 
warned, and Jessica watched as she reached into the 
incision and cut something inside. Jessica flinched. Shoes. 
Maroon clogs. Chunky heel, three inches. Patchwork 
stitching. The girl held out the scalpel, her hand still inside 
Afton’s body. “Take it; give me clamps.” Jessica took the 
scalpel and replaced it. 

“Clamps?” she asked, starting to panic as she searched 
among the instruments. 

“They look like scissors, with teeth instead of blades. 
Open them and hand them to me, and do it fast.” 

Shoes. Jelly sandals, purple, sparkly. Jessica grabbed the 
clamps and tried to open them, but they were stuck 
together, hooked by an odd clasp at the top. 

“Hurry up, do you want him to die?” 

Yes, | do! Jessica wanted to shout, but held her tongue. 
She pinched the scissor handles together, and they came 
free. She handed them to the girl, relieved, and watched as 
she stuck the pointed end into the opening and pinched 
whatever she had been holding, clamping it shut. She took 
her hand slowly out of the wound and looked at Jessica. 

“You have to be faster. Scalpel, then I'll need clamps 
right away.” 

Jessica nodded. 

Shoes. Green suede kitten heels with a rhinestone strap 
at the ankle. She handed the girl the scalpel, then wrestled 
the clamps open as fast as she could, and was holding them 
out by the time the bloody blade was returned to her. She 
watched dizzily as the animatronic girl made another cut, 
severing something she could not see, and using the last set 
of clamps to hold it shut. 


The table behind them began to hiss more loudly, and 
the orange glow intensified. Jessica took a step sideways to 
get away from the heat. The glow spread to the creature on 
the table, and parts of it seemed to turn from side to side. 

“Hold out your hands,” the girl said. 

Platform sneakers. Denim. Hideous. Jessica held out her 
hands for the clamps, but the girl left them in place. Instead, 
She slid both hands into Afton’s open body and lifted out a 
bloody object. His kidney, that’s his kidney. Black leather 
combat boots. Black leather combat boots. Charlie’s black 
leather combat boots. The animatronic girl held the kidney 
up in the air for a moment, and blood dripped from it onto 
her face. Charlie’s boots. Charlie. The girl turned to Jessica, 
and she shrank back. 

“Hold out your hands,” the girl repeated with cold 
insistence, and Jessica obeyed, fighting not to retch as the 
warm organ was placed gently in her hands. /t’s meat; it’s 
not part of a person; just think of it as meat. Platform 
sneakers. Stiletto boots. Penny loafers. She watched in a 
daze as the girl took a curved needle and black thread and 
began to sew William Afton back together, starting with his 
innards, and ending with the first incision, making a row of 
Xs across the left half of his body. At last she finished, 
Snipping the last thread off with practiced ease. 

“What's next?” Jessica asked, her voice sounding faint 
against the rushing in her ears. Yellow sneakers with a blue 
streak on the side. Those brown pumps Mom got me. Oh, 
Mom— 

“The next part is easy,” the girl said, pulling the gloves 
off and picking the kidney up again with her hand and 
approaching the table where the mass lay. 

“What are you going to do?” Jessica quivered. 


“What did you think all of this was for?” the girl said 
softly. “He told you: piece by piece.” 

Jessica looked down at the creature on the table, glowing 
orange at its core, and dripping fluid from its various parts, 
the drops landing with a hiss on the hot surface. 

“This is a transplant,” she said. 

The mass of melted parts fora moment looked human, 
its demeanor suddenly childlike as it squirmed, and its head 
turned to face Jessica. For just a moment, Jessica thought 
she could make out eyes looking back at her. Suddenly, the 
silence was broken as the animatronic girl clenched her fist 
around the kidney and slammed it against the creature’s 
chest, pressing so hard that the metal underneath sank 
inward, embedding the kidney deep inside where it gurgled 
and hissed. More fluid seeped out the sides of the creature 
and burned on the table, as the girl wrenched it back and 
forth inside. 

She pulled her hand from the cavity she had created, her 
hand charred black, and rested it at her side, extending and 
retracting her fingers as though making sure they still 
worked. 

“Now, we are done,” she said. She brushed past Jessica 
and went to the cabinet, and emerged with a long needle. 
She strode purposefully to William Afton’s side, stopped with 
her fist raised over her head, then brought the needle down, 
plunging it into his chest. 

A second passed, then he heaved an enormous breath 
and groaned. The girl pulled the needle from his chest and 
set it gently on the table beside him. William Afton opened 
his eyes, and his single eyeball moved back and forth 
between Jessica and the animatronic girl. 

“Is it done?” he asked. 


Jessica screamed. The intensity of it roused her from her 
daze and she screamed again, letting the sound drown out 
everything else. Her throat went raw, but she screamed 
again, clinging to the roar of her own voice; for an instant, 
She felt like if she kept screaming nothing worse could 
happen. 

The air around the girl shimmered, and Jessica’s vision 
blurred in front of her: something was moving. In a moment, 
her eyes cleared, and Charlie was standing in front of her. 

“Jessica, don’t worry! You can trust me,” Charlie said 
cheerfully. 





A hand was stroking her hair. The sun was going down over 
a field of grain. A cluster of birds were fluttering overhead, 
their calls echoing out over the landscape. “I’m so happy to 
be here with you,” a kind voice said. She looked up and 
nestled against him; her father smiled down at her, but 
there were tears in his eyes. Don’t cry, Daddy, she wanted 
to say, but when she tried to speak, the words did not come. 
She reached up to touch his face, but her hand passed 
through empty air: he was gone, and she was alone in the 
grass. Overhead the birds began to wail, and their calls 
sounded like human voices, breaking with despair. “Daddy!” 
Charlie screamed, but there was no answer, only the birds’ 
lamentation as the sun vanished beyond the horizon. 

It was dark, and he had not come back; all the birds were 
gone but one, and that one sounded more human with 


every cry. Charlie stood unsteadily; by some trick of time 
she was no longer a child, but a teenage girl, and the fields 
around her had turned to rubble; she stood in the midst of a 
ruined place, but there was a single wall standing in front of 
her, and a door at the center of it. The birds were silent, but 
someone was crying on the other side of the door, crying 
alone in a small, cramped space. She ran to it, banging her 
fists on the metal surface. “Let me in!” she cried. “Let me 
in! | have to get inside!” 

| have to get inside! Charlie sat bolt upright with a 
ragged gasp, inhaling like she’d just escaped from drowning. 
The doors—the closet. She threw off the gray wool blanket 
and sheets, tangling herself in the process before she 
managed to get free. She was so hot she could barely stand 
it, and the wool had been scratching where it touched her 
chin. She felt strange, more alert: the world was in sharp 
focus, and it was jarring, as if she had been drifting in some 
kind of shadowy, half-conscious state for days. Everything 
hurts, she’d managed to whisper to John, but it had been 
somehow detached from her, there was some buffer 
between her body and her mind. Now, her mind clear, the 
buffer was gone, and she ached all over, a dull, constant 
pain that seemed to be everywhere at once. She leaned 
back against the wall. She had not woken to sleepy 
disorientation—she knew exactly where she was. She was in 
John’s apartment, behind the couch. She was behind the 
couch, because ... 

“Someone is impersonating me,” she said uncertainly, 
and the sound of her own voice was Startling in the empty 
room. 

She got to her knees, not quite trusting her legs, then 
steadied herself on the back of the couch, getting to her 


feet with effort. She straightened, and was instantly dizzy, 
her head swimming as her knees threatened to buckle 
under her. Charlie gripped the back of the couch 
determinedly, picking a point on the wall and staring at it, 
willing the room to stop spinning. 

After a moment, it did, and Charlie realized the wall she 
was Staring at was a door. Doors. The thought made her 
light-headed again, but she kept a firm hand on the couch 
and made her way around to the front, then sat down on it 
carefully. She glanced around the room—so far all she had 
seen was the corner behind the sofa. The shades were 
pulled down, and she could see that the front door was 
bolted. Charlie lost interest in the rest of it, her eyes drawn 
back to the other door. It was scarcely ajar, the room behind 
it dark, and Charlie shivered, echoes of her dream 
reverberating in her head. Doors. Someone was on the other 
side, behind the door, somewhere small and dark; | was 
drawing them, doors; | had to find the door. Then... She 
closed her eyes, remembering. They were running, 
desperate to get away as the building thundered around 
them, already falling to pieces, when she saw the door. The 
door called to me; it was hidden in the wall, but | went to it, 
| knew exactly where it was. As | walked toward It, it was like 
| was on both sides—walking to it, and trapped behind it. 
Separated from myself. When | touched it, | could feel the 
beating of your heart, and then... Charlie’s eyes snapped 
open. “John pulled me away,” she said, the memory 
solidifying as she let herself dwell on it. “I didn’t want to go 
because ...” She heard it, suddenly: the hiss and the cracks 
appearing in the wall. “... because the door had started to 
open.” 


Charlie stood, her eyes glued to the door in John’s living 
room. She approached it as if propelled by the same 
instinctive force, her heart picking up its pace. “It’s just the 
bedroom, right?” she murmured, but still she edged toward 
it slowly. She stopped in front of the door and reached out 
tentatively, vaguely surprised when her fingers touched real 
wood. She pushed it gently and it swung open easily, 
revealing a girl identical to Charlie. 

A mirror. 

She looked the same. Her face was pale and strained, but 
it was her face, and she smiled instinctively. In the haze of 
the last few ... days? Weeks? She had been utterly 
disoriented, fading in and out of consciousness, pain finding 
her even in dreams. Charlie had not felt like herself, but 
there she was. She reached out to touch the mirror girl’s 
hand. “You, are you,” she said quietly. 

Behind her came the unmistakable sound of a lock being 
turned, and she whirled around in sudden panic, losing her 
balance and catching herself on John’s dresser. The front 
door opened and she shrank back, kneeling to let the 
dresser shield her. A clamor of voices burst in, all talking at 
once—there were too many to make out the words, until a 
familiar voice called, “Charlie?” 

Charlie didn’t move, waiting to be sure. Footsteps came 
to the doorway of the bedroom, then the voice again: 
“Charlie?” 

“Marla!” Charlie answered. “I’m here.” She started to get 
up, but her legs would not take her weight. “I can’t—” she 
started, tears of frustration pricking her eyes as Marla 
hurried over. 

“It’s okay,” Marla said hurriedly. “It’s okay, I'll help. It’s 
amazing you made it this far!” Charlie looked at her flatly, 


and Marla laughed. “I’m sorry,” she said. “It’s just—glaring 
at me like that you’re so...” 

“What?” 

“Charlie.” 

“Who else am | supposed to be?” Charlie smiled as Marla 
took hold of her wrist with medical authority and began to 
silently count. She looked past Marla to Carlton, who came 
over quickly. John was standing in the door, but he made no 
move to join them, not meeting Charlie’s eyes. 

“| didn’t want to crowd you,” Carlton said, sitting down 
beside her and crossing his legs. “Charlie, l’m—” He broke 
off and swallowed, looking away. “I’m really glad to see 
you,” he said to the floor. 

“I’m glad to see you, too,” Charlie said. She looked back 
to Marla, who nodded briskly. 

“Your pulse is a little slow,” she said. “I want to check it 
again in a few minutes. | want you to drink some water.” 
Charlie nodded. 

“Okay,” she said bemusedly. 

“Let’s get her onto the bed,” Marla said to Carlton, who 
nodded and, before Charlie could protest, scooped her up 
into his arms. Charlie glanced around for John, but he had 
disappeared. 

Marla pulled the blankets back. Charlie felt the pull of 
Sleep, like something standing behind her, gently tugging. 
She blinked rapidly, trying to rouse herself as Carlton set 
her down. Marla started to pull the blankets over her, and 
Charlie waved her hands, ineffectually trying to push them 
away. 

“I’m too hot,” she said, and Marla stopped. 

“Okay,” she said. “They’re here if you need them.” 
Charlie nodded. The tugging was growing stronger: if she 


just closed her eyes, she would slip back into the dark. 
Marla and Carlton were talking to each other, but it was 
getting harder to keep track of what they were saying. 

A loud bang rattled the small apartment, and Charlie 
jolted awake, her heart thudding alarmingly. Almost 
instantly, Marla’s hand was on her shoulder. “It’s just John,” 
she said. 

“Il think my heart rate is back up,” Charlie said, 
attempting to joke, but Marla turned on her with appraising 
eyes, grabbed her wrist, and started to count again. “Marla, 
I’m fine,” Charlie said, halfheartedly pulling away. Marla held 
on for another few seconds, then released her. 

In the living room, John set something down on the floor 
with force. Carlton gave Charlie a concerned glance, then 
helped her off the bed, giving her an arm to lean on as they 
went out into the living room to join John. For a moment, the 
object was obscured, then they all moved aside so she could 
see the child-size doll. Charlie sat down on the floor, a little 
apart from the others. 

“Ella,” she whispered. Some tight, painful knot inside her 
chest began to loosen, and she felt herself smile. “John, how 
did you find her?” she asked. John knelt down behind the 
doll and looked up at her grimly, and her smile faded. 
“What's wrong?” she asked. He didn’t answer her. 

“Everyone, keep your eyes on the doll,” he said instead, 
and took something out of his pocket. He flicked his thumb 
against the object, a tiny motion, and the air around Ella 
shimmered for a moment, blurring her. Charlie rubbed her 
eyes and heard Marla gasp. Ella was gone: standing where 
she had been was a little girl about three years old, dressed 
in Ella’s clothes. The knot in Charlie’s chest started to 
tighten again. 


“What is this, John?” Marla asked sharply. John flicked his 
thumb again, and the shimmer passed over the girl, then 
she was a doll again, her vacant eyes staring placidly into 
eternity. Charlie darted her eyes from one to the next: Marla 
looked scared, but Carlton was fascinated. John, for some 
reason, seemed angry. Charlie shifted uneasily. John 
manipulated the object in his hand again, and the little girl 
appeared once more. Carlton crouched down to look at her, 
and Marla bent down to see, keeping her distance. 

John stood, leaving them to stare at Ella, and knelt 
beside Charlie, giving her the same dark look he’d had since 
he brought in the doll. “What is this?” he asked harshly, and 
Charlie stared at him, hurt. John looked away with a pained 
expression, his face flushed. When he looked back at 
Charlie, the anger in his face had faded, but was not gone. 
“| need to Know what this is.” 

“I! don’t know,” she said. John nodded, and sat on the 
floor with her, carefully leaving a wide space between them. 
He opened his hand: in it was a small, flat disc. Charlie 
didn’t move to touch it—there was something odd in his 
manner, something untrusting she had never seen in him 
before. 

“Did you know?” 

“No.” Charlie tilted her head, staring at the motionless 
little girl. 

“It’s the same as Afton’s creatures, though, isn’t it?” John 
said. “Pattern projection, bombarding the mind; 
overwhelming the senses—” 

“This one is different, though,” Charlie cut in. She 
shivered, though she wasn’t cold, suddenly unable to shake 
the memory of the twisted bear, his face stripped to the 
metal staves, the illusion sparking on and off as he loomed 


over them. “Can | see it?” she said, forcing herself back to 
the present. John held out the disc, and she took it carefully, 
watching him warily. He was giving off the sense of a 
brewing storm, and she was afraid of setting it off. Charlie 
held the disc up to the light, turning it back and forth, then 
handed it back. 

“That’s it?” John’s eyes widened. 

“What do you want me to say?” she cried. 

“| mean, you can’t tell me anything about it?” 

“The others all had that inscription: Afton Robotics. This 
one doesn’t. But I’d bet you noticed that.” 

“Actually, | didn’t.” John looked at her thoughtfully, then 
back down at the disc. He flipped the switch, and Marla 
yelped in surprise. “Sorry! It’s a bit jarring if you aren’t 
expecting it,” he said, turning back to Charlie with a grin. 
She smiled, and as he met her eyes, his smile faltered, 
something troubling passing over his face. Before she could 
speak, it was gone. He grinned widely and winked at her, 
then flipped the switch—Marla cried out again, and Carlton 
laughed. 

“Stop doing that!” Marla shouted from several feet away. 

John ignored her, and leaned in closer to Charlie, 
hesitantly, like he thought she might run away. She turned 
to face him, a wave of nervousness washing over her. She 
ducked her head, letting her hair fall over her face, and he 
reached out and touched it gently, brushing a strand out of 
her eyes. He gave her a small smile and flipped the switch 
once, then again. 

“That’s enough,” Marla called. “This is too weird for me.” 

John didn’t seem to hear her; he was looking at Charlie 
with a new troubled expression. 

“What is it?” she asked quietly. 


“Nothing,” he said. He touched her hair again, this time 
brushing it back from her face and tucking it behind her ear. 
“Hey,” he said abruptly, changing his tone. “Do you 
remember your experiment from last year?” She nodded 
eagerly, then stopped, freshly aware of how long she had 
been away. 

“My faces. But they must be gone, everything must be 
gone.” She looked at John with anxious eyes, but he smiled. 

“Nothing’s gone,” he said, and her heart lifted; she felt 
as if he had just given her a gift. “Jessica packed up all your 
stuff; she’s got it in her apartment.” 

“Oh,” Charlie said, darting her eyes around the room. 
“Jessica? Where is she?” 

“Charlie,” John said patiently, and she tried to focus on 
him; she could feel her attention waning, as if her mind 
were spreading thin, floating out like clouds. “The faces,” 
John went on. “There was an earpiece so they could 
recognize you, right?” 

She nodded. 

“Could you make it work the other way?” 

Charlie thought for a moment then met his eyes again. 
“You mean, make it so that the animatronics can’t see you?” 
She frowned, her focus returning as she concentrated on the 
problem. “The earpieces emit a frequency that alerts the 
animatronics to you, it makes you visible. If you inverted 
that frequency ...” She paused again. “I don’t know if it 
would work, John. It might.” 

“It could make us invisible to them?” 

“Maybe, but that’s a big leap.” 

“How would | do it? Invert the frequency?” 

Charlie shrugged. “Just switch the wires, and ...” 


“Charlie, what part of ‘stay in bed’ wasn’t clear?” Marla 
asked good-naturedly, coming over to them. John stood, his 
mouth hanging open as though Marla had interrupted 
Charlie’s answer, but she didn’t seem poised to add more. 

“Sorry,” he said hastily. 

“Be careful,” Charlie said. She was beginning to feel 
light-headed again, and when Marla reached out to help her 
back to the bedroom, she did not protest. 


* OK OX 


John paused in the door, watching as Charlie curled up on 
her side, her eyes already closed. Marla raised her 
eyebrows, and he left, shutting the door halfway. In the 
living room, Carlton was kneeling beside Ella—now in doll 
form again—and looking intently into her ear. 

“Uh, Carlton?” John said dubiously, and Carlton sat back 
on his heels. 

“Amazing,” he said. “She looked human, like actually, for 
real, a human child.” 

“Yeah, | think that was the idea. Can we talk outside?” 
John asked brusquely, and Carlton looked at him in surprise. 

“Sure,” Carlton said with some concern in his voice. 

“Come on.” John headed for the door, and Carlton hurried 
after him. Once they were outside, John looked at Carlton for 
a moment, thinking. 

“What's the idea?” Carlton asked with a hint of suspicion. 

“Let me try to get this straight in my own head first,” 
John said. “Last year, when she was still in school, Charlie 
had this experiment she was doing, something about 
teaching robots language.” 


“Oh yeah!” Carlton nodded enthusiastically. “She told me 
about it. Natural language programming. They listen to 
people talking around them, and to them, and they learn to 
talk, too. Didn’t sound like it worked very well, though.” 

“Well, whatever. She had these earpieces—like, the 
robots would only talk to each other—they only recognized 
each other. You with me so far?” 

“Um, | think?” 

“Well, if you, Carlton, wanted to be /non the 
conversation, you would need to wear a special earpiece. 
The earpieces would make them recognize you. Otherwise, 
you were just part of the background, like they couldn’t see 
you.” 

“Okay?” Carlton gave him a puzzled look, and John rolled 
his eyes. 

“Wearing the earpieces included you in their 
conversation. It made you one of them, from their 
perspective.” 

“Hate to break it to you, but the big ones already see us 
... at least I’m pretty sure they do. See this scar?” 

“Will you shut up for a second?” John said. “Il asked 
Charlie, and she said we might be able to reverse engineer 
it. We can switch the wires, and instead of the earpieces 
including us, it would deliberately exc/ude us.” 

Carlton furrowed his brow. 

“It could effectively make us invisible ...” John prompted. 

“Switch the wires,” Carlton repeated. “It would mask us, 
and make us not a part of the world they can perceive.” 

“Right.” John nodded. 

Carlton waited for John to go on, then added, “What do 
you want me to do?” 


“Go to Jessica’s house. She’s got all of Charlie’s old stuff 
boxed up in a closet. If she’s not there, she leaves her spare 
key under the welcome mat.” 

Carlton raised his eyebrows. “Under the welcome mat? 
That’s a horrible place to leave a key!” 

“It’s a good neighborhood,” John said defensively. 

Carlton raised his eyebrows. “Yeah, it’s a good 
neighborhood, John. Nothing bad ever happens here.” 
Carlton slapped John on the shoulder as he headed for his 
car. “I’m on it!” he called. 

John let out a sigh, then went back inside. Marla was 
sitting on the couch, staring at the television, which was not 
turned on. 

“How is she?” John asked, sitting down beside her, and 
she shrugged. 

“Okay, considering the circumstances.” She turned away 
from the blank screen, looking distressed. “She was locked 
in a box! That’s insane, she was locked in a box! Who knows 
for how long—days, months? She must have been fed, given 
water, or she’d have starved, but she has no memory of it, 
she just remembers drifting in and out of sleep. She seems 
healthy. | don’t know what to Say.” 

Impulsively, John hugged her, and she sighed, hugging 
him back tightly. She released him abruptly, looking away as 
she brushed at her eyes. John pretended not to see. 

“Can | go sit with her for a minute?” he said when she 
straightened. “I won’t bother her, | just want to sit with her 
and know she’s there.” 

Marla nodded, her eyes brightening with tears again. 
“Don’t wake her up,” she admonished as he went to the 
door. He nodded, and slipped inside, closing the door behind 
him.

Carlton pulled into the lot outside Jessica’s apartment 
building, glancing around for her car. It didn’t seem to be 
there. 

“Guess I'll be breaking and entering; sorry, Jess,” he said 
cheerfully as he pulled into a spot, but a sense of dread had 
already set in. He wanted company, even on this small 
errand. “Let’s see what skeletons Jessica has hiding in her 
closet.” He drummed his hands on the steering wheel, 
tamping down his nerves, and got out of the car. 

Jessica lived on the third floor. Carlton had only been to 
her place once, but he found it again easily. In front of her 
door was a welcome mat: it was dark green, the word 
WELCOME written out in black script. Carlton lifted the mat, 
but there was nothing under it. 

For a moment he stared, at a loss for what to do next, 
then he flipped the mat all the way over: taped to the center 
was a key. “Thought you could outsmart me?” he 
murmured, peeling off the clear tape. 

“Can | help you?” someone asked sternly from behind 
him. Carlton froze. The voice said nothing else, and so with 
deliberate movements he finished removing the key, set the 
mat back on the ground, and smoothed it back into place, 
trying to seem unconcerned. He put a pleasant expression 
on his face, stood, and turned to face an elderly man 
scowling at him from across the hall. He was wearing a 
faded button-up shirt and holding a hefty book, his finger 
marking his place. 

“Do | know you?” the man demanded. Carlton forced a 
grin and waved the key in the air. 


“Just visiting,” he said. “I’m a friend of Jessica’s.” The old 
man peered at him suspiciously. 

“She makes too much noise,” he said, and shut his door. 
Carlton heard three locks snap into place, then silence. He 
waited a moment, then turned and hurriedly entered 
Jessica’s apartment. 

He shut the door carefully behind him and glanced 
around. The apartment was no bigger—or nicer—than 
John’s, although it was definitely cleaner. Most of the 
furniture had probably come with the place, but Jessica had 
determinedly made it her own. The scuffed floor was as 
spotless as it could be made without an industrial sander, 
and Carlton looked guiltily down at his sneakers, thinking 
maybe he should have taken them off outside. Jessica had 
covered the worn-out couch in fluffy blankets and throw 
pillows; her textbooks were lined up neatly on a wide 
bookshelf made out of brightly painted wood planks, and 
above the shelf was a large corkboard full of photographs, 
cards, and ticket stubs. Carlton made his way over to it, 
curious. “Let’s see what Jessica’s been up to,” he said, 
talking to himself just to fill the silence. 

The corkboard was full of smiling pictures of Jessica with 
her friends; a graduation photo with her parents; ticket 
stubs from concerts and movies; two birthday cards, anda 
few postcards with enthusiastically—and illegibly—scribbled 
notes. Carlton let out a low whistle. “Somebody’s popular,” 
he muttered, then something else caught his eye: a child’s 
drawing, pinned to the lower corner of the board. He bent 
down to look, and his throat caught: it was a crayon drawing 
of five children, smiling happily as they posed with a big 
yellow rabbit. In the bottom left corner, the artist had signed 
his name, and Carlton reached out to touch it lightly. 


“Michael,” he whispered. He stared into the bright eyes of 
the yellow rabbit behind the children and his mouth went 
dry. /f only | could have warned you, somehow. 

He swallowed and straightened up, turning his attention 
deliberately back to the photos. 

“She sure gets out a lot,” he remarked, opening one of 
the cards to distract himself. HAPPY 15TH BIRTHDAY, JESSICA! it 
read, and he stepped back, feeling slightly ashamed as 
suddenly he understood. He glanced at the ticket stubs: 
they were all from shows in New York; the pictures with 
friends were all a few years old. Jessica’s new life, here, 
didn’t give her much in the way of mementos. Carlton 
turned away from the corkboard, wishing he had not 
intruded. 

“The closet,” he said loudly. “I have to find the closet 
with the stuff.” There was a kitchenette, and past that a 
hallway, presumably leading to the bedroom. He found a 
light switch and flipped it on, and the closet appeared, 
halfway down the hall. He opened it, half expecting the 
contents to come tumbling down on him, but though these 
were Charlie’s possessions, it was Jessica who had done the 
packing. Stacks of cardboard boxes filled the closet 
completely, each one labeled clearly: CHARLIE—SHIRTS AND 
SOCKS, CHARLIE—BOOKS, etc. At the very top of the stack was a 
long, flat box labeled, CHARLIE—WEIRD EXPERIMENT. 

“Weird experiment; feels like the story of my life these 
days,” Carlton whispered. He reached for it carefully, and 
had almost gotten it down when he knocked the corner 
against the box underneath it, sending, CHARLIE—MISCELLANEOUS 
to the ground. The box split open, soewing out computer 
parts and random bolts and scraps of metal, fur, and two 


unattached paws. Three plastic eyes bounced as they hit 
the floor, then rolled across the carpet, clacking against 
each other merrily. 

“This is life or death; someone else can clean it up,” 
Carlton decided. He stepped carefully over the rest of the 
mess, and carried the box into Jessica’s bedroom. He set it 
down on her bed, careful of the pale blue spread, and 
dragged the spare key across the packing tape to cut it. He 
opened the box. 

“Yikes.” He startled. Two identical faces stood upright in 
the box, staring at each other with blank eyes. They were 
like unfinished statues: they had features, but they were not 
refined, and seemed incapable of expression. He started to 
lift them out of the box, then realized that they were 
attached to something. With care, he managed to extract 
the entire structure: a large, black box with knobs and 
buttons, and the faces on their stand, wired to it. It all 
seemed to be intact. Carlton eyed the wall socket by 
Jessica’s bed for a moment, then grabbed the cord, and 
plugged the whole thing in. An array of lights came on, red 
and green, flashing on and off seemingly at random, then 
stabilizing: some off, some on. Several fans started to whir. 
Carlton looked at the faces: they were stretching, almost 
mimicking human movement. “Creepy,” he whispered. 

“You, me,” said the first, and he jumped back, 
disconcerted. 

“We, she,” said the second. He stared, waiting for more, 
but they were apparently finished for the moment, 
motionless and silent. Carlton shook his head, trying to 
make himself focus, though all he really wanted to do was 
sit here and watch the two faces, and see what else they 
might have to say. Or talk to them. He went back to the box: 


the earpieces John had described were wrapped up in a thin 
layer of bubble wrap. They looked like hearing aids, small 
clear pieces of plastic, full of wiring, with a tiny switch on 
one side. Carlton flipped the switch on one, and put it in his 
ear. Instantly, the faces turned to him, tilting up like they 
were looking straight at him. Can they see me? 

“Hi?” Carlton said reluctantly. 

“Who?” one asked. 

“Carlton,” he answered nervously. 

“You,” the other said. 

“Me,” said the first. 

“You guys really love pronouns, huh?” Carlton said. There 
was no answer from the faces. He took out the earpiece and 
flipped the switch off, and simultaneously the faces turned 
back to each other. Makes you visible. Right, he thought 
with a shiver. He turned back to the earpiece itself, sliding 
his thumbnail into the thin seam that ran around the edge of 
the casing. It popped open easily, revealing a mess of wires 
and a tiny computer chip. “Just switch the wires, it’s that 
easy,” he muttered to himself. There was a lamp ona 
nightstand beside Jessica’s bed, and he turned it on, holding 
the earpiece under the light. He stared at it, looking for a 
clue as to what John had been suggesting, angling the tiny 
object from side to side. At last he spotted it: a single, 
empty round input, outlined in red. “And why is nothing 
plugged in to you?” Carlton said triumphantly. He sorted 
through the other wires until he found one that matched it, 
the outline green. He quickly switched the wire to the red- 
lined plug and snapped the case back together, then 
switched it on and stuck it back in his ear. The faces did not 
move. 


“What's wrong? Don’t want to talk to me anymore?” he 
said loudly. There was no response. “Excellent,” he said, 
satisfied. He took out the earpiece and put it in his pocket, 
then grabbed the other one as well. He unplugged the 
experiment and was about to pack it back into the box, 
when he felt a sudden prickling between his shoulders, as if 
someone was Standing directly behind him. He could almost 
feel breath on his neck. Carlton held very still, scarcely 
breathing, then he spun around, his hands raised to defend 
himself. 

The room was empty. He flicked his eyes from side to 
side, unconvinced that he was alone, but there was nothing 
there. “Just pack up and get out,” he said weakly, but his 
heart was still pounding in his chest like he was fighting for 
his life. He took a deep breath, and went back to the 
experiment. Before he could touch it, the room dipped 
under him like a ship bobbing in the ocean, and he fell to his 
knees, clutching the bed frame to steady himself. His vision 
blurred: nothing was fixed in place anymore, everything in 
the room seemed like it was moving at various speeds and 
different directions. Carlton let go of the bed frame and sank 
to the floor as a piercing whine arose, quickly ascending to a 
pitch too high to perceive. He covered his ears, but it did 
nothing to ease the nausea. The room kept spinning, and his 
stomach lurched; he groaned, holding his head and closing 
his eyes, but the movement continued. He clenched his 
teeth, grimly determined not to vomit. What is happening? 

Carlton ... Carlton ... Someone called his name sweetly, 
and he looked. One thing in the room was still: an enormous 
pair of eyes, staring at him as the room rocked sickeningly. 
He tried to stand, but as soon as he moved, dizziness and 
nausea overwhelmed him. He pressed his cheek to the cool 


floor, desperate for relief, but it only made the room spin 
faster. 

“Carlton?” 

The room snapped back into focus; everything stopped 
moving. Carlton didn’t move, afraid of setting it all off again. 
“Carlton, are you okay?” said a familiar voice, and he looked 
up to see Charlie, bent over him anxiously. 

“Charlie?” he said weakly. “What are you doing here?” 

“John sent me to help. What were you doing with all this 
stuff?” she asked. 

“I’m sorry, | hope | didn’t break anything,” he said, sitting 
up carefully. The nausea still lingered, but it was easing as 
he began to trust that the room had steadied itself. He 
glanced at Charlie, his vision still a little fuzzy. 

“| don’t mind, it’s all junk anyway. But the way you were 
rolling around on the floor, you must have activated 
something, or electrocuted yourself, one or the other. Are 
you Okay?” 

“I think so,” he said. He slumped back against the bed. 

“Nausea? Room spinning?” she asked sympathetically. 

“Terrible,” he said. 

She put a hand on his shoulder. “Come on, we need to 
get out of here.” She stood and held out a hand to help him 
up; he took it, standing gingerly, the effects of whatever it 
had been were almost completely gone. He looked around 
the room, his vision clear. 

“What exactly were you doing?” Charlie asked, and 
Carlton froze. Her voice was too hard, too ... polished. He 
turned to her, keeping his face neutral. 

“He didn’t say? John thought you might want to have it, 
your old experiment. | think he wanted to surprise you with 
it,” he said. He grinned. “Surprise!” 


Charlie smiled. 

“You know, your old experiment?” Carlton’s mind raced. 
“The one with the robotic hand that could play the piano?” 
he added. “You remember?” 

“Right. How sweet of you to come get it,” she said, a 
flirtatious note in her voice, and Carlton’s blood went cold. 
He nodded carefully. 

“You know me. Always thinking of others,” he said, 
glancing over Charlie’s shoulder at the bedroom door 
behind her. It was closed. She took a step closer to him, and 
he stepped back instinctively. She looked surprised for a 
moment, then grinned, looking down and seeing the two 
faces in the box. He moved back again, startling when he hit 
the wall behind him. 

“Carlton, if | didn’t know better I’d think you were afraid 
of me,” Charlie said in a low voice, stepping so close there 
was almost no space between them, pinning him to the wall. 
She reached out toward his face, and he set his jaw, trying 
not to flinch. She ran her fingers down his cheek, then 
traced the line of his jaw. He didn’t move, his breathing 
Shallow. Charlie brushed his hair out of his face and pressed 
closer to him, trailing her hand to the back of his neck. Her 
face was inches from his. 

“Um, Charlie, you’re not really my type, you know?” he 
managed to Say. 

She smiled. “You haven’t even given me a chance. Are 
you sure?” she whispered. 

“Yeah, I’m sure. | mean don’t get me wrong, you’re okay- 
looking, but let’s be honest, you’re nothing to write home 
about,” he quipped, maintaining eye contact. “I mean, those 
boots with that skirt?” 

Charlie’s grin started to wane. 


“Sorry, that was rude. I’m sure you'll find a guy someday 
who appreciates you for who you are.” He tried to inch his 
way toward the door. “Now, if you'll excuse me, I’m late for 
quartet practice, so let me just get by you and I'll be on my 
way.” 

Carlton squirmed but Charlie didn’t budge. “I promise | 
won't tell anyone that | rejected you. Just hit that gym and 
we can try again in a few years.” 

“Carlton, you’re obviously flustered. There’s only one 
way to really be sure how you feel,” Charlie said softly. She 
leaned closer, and Carlton screwed his eyes shut. The 
earpiece. It was in his right pocket. 

“Charlie, you’re right, but maybe we should just talk fora 
while, you know. | rushed into my last relationship and | 
almost ended up dead in a moldy fur suit.” /ust distract her 
until ... his fingers closed on the earpiece, and he pulled it 
from his pocket, opening his eyes at the same time. 

Carlton screamed. 

Charlie’s face was splitting apart. Her skin had taken ona 
plastic cast, it was cracked at the middle, splintering into 
triangular sections. As he watched, her hand tightening 
around his neck, the triangles lifted up and pulled back like 
razor-edged flower petals, revealing an entirely different 
face, sleek and feminine, but definitely not human. The 
petals of what had been Charlie’s face began to move along 
the round perimeter of the new face, beginning to look more 
like a saw blade than a flower. The animatronic girl pursed 
her metal lips, leaning in for a kiss as the blades spun closer 
and closer to Carlton’s face. In a final burst of self- 
preservation, he yanked the earpiece out of his pocket and 
jammed it into his ear, flipping the switch. 


The animatronic girl drew back at once, letting go of 
Carlton’s neck with a surprised look on her metal face. She 
glanced around the room. He stared at her, frozen in terror 
for a moment, then he realized what was happening. She 
can’t see me. He waited, watching as she took deliberate 
steps backward, her eyes darting back and forth. She stood 
for a moment, the plates of her face snapping back together 
to form the painted, glossy face of a doll, then suddenly a 
ripple of light passed over her and she appeared to be 
Charlie again, her face expressionless. After another minute, 
she turned and went to the bedroom closet. She peered in, 
pushing clothes out of it as if something might be hidden 
behind them, then stepped away. She went to the bed and 
grabbed a corner, then lifted it off the ground. She 
considered the empty floor for a second, then let the bed 
drop with a crash. Once more she scanned the room, and at 
last, she opened the door to the bedroom and let herself 
out. Carlton tiptoed behind her, following her into the hall. 
She stopped short in front of the hall closet, and he almost 
bumped into her, barely catching himself before they 
collided. 

The animatronic girl ripped the boxes from the neatly 
stacked closet, tossing them haphazardly on the ground 
behind her. Carlton cautiously stepped back a few feet. 

When the girl was satisfied the closet was unoccupied, 
she checked the bathroom, then walked out into the living 
room. With one last, dissatisfied glance around, the 
animatronic girl left Jessica’s apartment, closing the door 
calmly behind her. Carlton rushed to the window, watching 
as she exited the building and walked away down the road, 
heading toward the town. 


Once she was out of sight, Carlton heaved a sigh, 
gasping as if he had been holding his breath. He felt dizzy 
again, light-headed, but this time it was only fading 
adrenaline. He started to take the earpiece out, then 
thought better of it and left it in place. He patted his left 
pocket, reassuring himself that the second earpiece was still 
there, and he hurried out of the apartment and down to his 
car. He drove away urgently, heading toward John’s house 
without regard for the speed limit, and hoping the 
animatronic girl was going the other direction. 


* OK OX 


Charlie heard the door close, and she turned toward it. The 
room was dark except for the light filtering in through the 
small, dirty window, and she squinted to see who had just 
come in. 

“John?” she whispered. 

“Yeah,” he said in the same tone. “Did | wake you up?” 

“It’s okay, all | do lately is sleep, and dream.” The last 
word was bitter on her tongue, and he must have heard it, 
too, because he sat down on the chair Marla had placed 
beside the bed. 

“Is it okay if | sit?” he asked nervously, already there. 

“Yes,” she said. Charlie closed her eyes. The room was 
different now. Safer. “You said something,” she murmured, 
almost to herself, and John leaned closer. 

“Did |? What did | say?” He cleared his throat, his palms 
already sweating. 

“You said ... you loved me,” she whispered, and he jolted 
as if someone had struck him. 


“Yes,” he said, his voice sounding choked-off. “That is 
what | said to you. You remember that?” Charlie nodded 
carefully, knowing her response was inadequate. He turned 
away from her for a second, letting out a forced breath. “It’s 
true. | do!” he said in a rush, turning back to her. “I mean, 
you've been my friend since forever. Just like Marla or 
Carlton or Jessica. | would have said that to any of them. 
Well, maybe not Jessica. So, you remember some of that 
night, then?” he asked briskly. 

“It’s all | remember. And the door. John!” She grasped his 
arm, alarmed. “John, the door was opening, | think Sammy 
was inside—I could feel him there, his heartbeat ...” She 
trailed off as another memory overwhelmed her, a moment 
in the strange, artificial cave under the restaurant that was 
So like Freddy’s, and yet so unlike it. “Springtrap,” she said. 
“| fought with him. There was a metal spike, and his head 
...”” She could see him, gasping on the rocks as she ground 
the piece of metal torturously into his wound. 

“Il know; | saw it, too,” John said, an uncomfortable shift 
in his eyes. 

“He said, ‘I didn’t take him. | took you.’” 

“What?” John gave her a puzzled look, and she sighed in 
frustration. 

“Sammy! | asked him why, why he took my brother from 
me, and that was what he said. ‘I took you.’” 

“Well, you’re here now. He’s insane, anyway.” John 
attempted a smile. “He probably just said it to hurt you, to 
confuse you.” 

“Well, it worked.” She let her head sink back onto the 
pillow. “John, everyone’s avoiding the question: How long 
has it been? | Know it’s been more than days, but how bad is 
it? A month?” 


He didn’t answer. 

“Two months?” she ventured. “I Know it can’t be more 
than a year or you'd have a nicer apartment,” she said 
weakly, and he winced. “John, tell me,” Charlie insisted, 
hearing her own voice rising, her heart beating faster as she 
waited for him to speak. 

“Six months,” he said at last. She didn’t move. She could 
hear the blood rushing in her ears. 

“Where have | been?” she asked, her voice barely 
audible over the rushing sound. 

“Your aunt Jen, you were with her, at least | think that’s 
where you were.” 

“You think?” 

“I'll tell you everything, Charlie, | promise—as soon as | 
understand it myself. There are things | just don’t know,” he 
finished helplessly. She lay back, staring up at the ceiling. In 
the dim light, the stains looked like they could be 
decorative. 

“About your aunt,” John went on, something awful in his 
voice. “I saw her that night.” 

Charlie looked sharply at him. “That night?” 

“The building was coming down; you were inside, and | 
was trying to get to you, and she was just suddenly there— | 
don’t know how she got in, or why.” 

“It was her house, technically,” Charlie said, turning back 
to the ceiling. “Maybe she was there looking for me.” 

“And that makes sense to you?” 

“I! don’t know what makes sense,” she said steadily. “It 
doesn’t make sense what | remember and what | don’t 
remember. There’s no one moment where suddenly it all 
goes blank. But | don’t remember Aunt Jen being there.” 

“Okay,” he said. 


“| have to see her,” Charlie said with sudden intensity. 
“She’s the only one who knows how all of the pieces fit; 
she’s the one with all the secrets. She’s always tried to 
protect me from them, but now ... secrets aren’t protecting 
anyone.” 

She stopped: John looked stricken, his face stuck 
between expressions like he was afraid to move it. “John?” 
Charlie said, a knot forming in her stomach. John took a 
breath as if to soeak, then hesitated; she could see he was 
searching for words. She gave them to him. “She’s dead, 
isn’t she?” Charlie said faintly. She felt like she was drifting 
off again, but she was not losing consciousness. John 
nodded. 

“I’m sorry, Charlie,” he said hoarsely. “I couldn’t stop it.” 

Charlie looked back up at the stains. / should feel 
something, she thought. “You need your head clear,” she 
whispered, echoing her aunt’s habitual reminder. 

“What?” John was watching her anxiously. 

“Paperwork,” she said more loudly. “She kept files on 
everything, locked up in cabinets. Whatever she knew, she 
wrote it down, or someone else did. Where was she?” 

“A house, in Silver Reef, the ghost town,” John 
stammered; he looked taken aback. “There were files there, 
boxes of papers.” 

“Then we have to go back there,” Charlie said firmly. John 
looked as if he wanted to protest, but he just nodded. 

“She might go back there, too, if she thinks you'll be 
there.” John shared a worried look. 

“We have to go.” 

“Then we go there,” he said. Charlie closed her eyes, the 
decision releasing her into sleepiness. The door opened, and 
dimly, Charlie heard Marla and John whispering to each 


other. She took a deep breath, like she was going 
underwater, and let herself slip into the dark. 





Hey!” Something poked Jessica’s shoulder, and she 
shrugged it away and rolled over, still half-asleep. “Wey, you 
okay?” Something poked her cheek, much harder, and she 
opened her eyes and looked up to see a ring of children 
surrounding her, staring with wide eyes. Jessica screamed. 

Someone grabbed her from behind, covering her mouth, 
and she struggled to get away. 

“You have to be quiet,” a desperate voice whispered, and 
she turned to face a red-haired girl of about seven, looking 
at her anxiously. “If you’re not quiet, it’ll come get you,” she 
explained. 

Jessica sat up carefully and put a hand on her head; it 
felt like it was stuffed with cotton, and her sinuses were 
burning. “Not again.” Chloroform, or whatever that gas was. 

“What?” the girl asked. 


“Nothing,” Jessica said, looking at the frightened faces 
that surrounded her. There were four children in all, two 
boys and two girls: There was the young redheaded girl with 
freckles on her nose, and a stocky, African American boy of 
about the same age, who looked like he had been crying 
before she arrived. He was sitting cross-legged with a young 
Latina girl of three or four on his lap, hiding her face in his 
Shirt. Her fine brown hair had all but come loose from two 
long braids down her back, each capped with a pink ribbon, 
and the matching pink shorts and T-shirt she wore were 
stained and filthy. The last little boy, a skinny blond 
kindergartener with a massive bruise on his forearm, hung 
back a little from the rest, his hair hanging over his face. 
They were all looking at her like they expected her to do 
something. 

“What is this disgusting place?” Jessica wiped her hands 
on her shirt and shook out her hair as though it might be full 
of spiders. She stopped in midshake, and turned to the kids 
as though seeing them again for the first time. Her mouth 
hung open slightly. 

“You're the kids.” She gasped. “I mean, you’re the kids, 
the ones that were taken, and you're alive!” She suddenly 
remembered the mother at the hospital. We have to find 
that kid and bring him home, Jessica had insisted to John, 
the words sounding hollow even to her own ears. Now the 
kids were standing right in front of her. /t’s not too late to 
save you, she thought, filling her with new purpose. She 
looked at the little blond boy. “Are you Jacob?” she asked, 
her heart fluttering, and his eyes widened in response. 

“Hey, it’s going to be okay,” she said, trying to believe 
her own words. “I’m Jessica.” None of them answered her 
right away, instead glancing at one another, trying to reach 


some silent consensus. Leaving them to it, Jessica stood, 
surveying their surroundings. 

It was a dank, brick-walled room with a very low ceiling, 
so low that Jessica couldn’t fully stand upright. The room 
had exposed pipes all along the walls, some of them giving 
off plumes of steam. There was a large tank in one corner, 
probably a hot-water heater, and in the far corner was a 
door. Jessica went to it. 

“Don’t!” the redheaded girl squealed. 

“It’s okay,” Jessica said, trying to make her tone 
soothing. “I’m going to get us all out of here. Let’s just see if 
it’s locked,” she said, hearing her own voice ring out 
cheerful and hearty. She sounded patronizing; it was a tone 
she’d always despised in adults when she was a child. “I'll 
just check,” she said more normally. She walked briskly 
toward the door. 

“No!” three voices cried. Jessica hesitated, then grasped 
the knob firmly and gave it a twist. Nothing happened. 
Behind her, one of the children let out a sigh of relief. 

“It’s okay,” Jessica said, turning back to them. “There’s 
always another way out.” She scanned their anxious, grimy 
faces. “What happened here?” she asked. The boy with the 
child on his lap looked at her suspiciously. 

“Why should we tell you anything? You could be one of 
them.” 

“I’m in here, same as you,” Jessica pointed out. She 
dropped down to sit beside him, putting herself on the 
children’s eye level. “My name is Jessica.” 

“Ron,” he said. The little girl on his lap tapped his 
shoulder, and he bent down as she whispered something in 
his ear. “Her name’s Lisa,” he added. 


“Alanna,” the redhead said, a little too loudly. The blond 
boy didn’t say anything. Jessica eyed him, but did not ask. 

“Hi, Ron, Lisa, Alanna, and, Jacob,” Jessica said with 
excruciating patience. “Can you tell me what happened?” 

“She ate me in her tummy,” Lisa whispered. Instantly, 
Jessica felt the blood rush from her face. 

“You mean the clown girl?” Jessica asked softly. “The 
robot girl?” The children nodded in unison. 

“| was in the woods,” Alanna said. She held her hand 
against her stomach, then mimed the clamp shooting out. 
“Chomp!” she said, her face deadly serious. 

“| was riding my bike by my house,” Ron said. “There was 
a woman in the road—she came out of nowhere, and | fell 
off the bike, | was trying not to hit her.” He gestured to his 
knees, and Jessica noticed for the first time that they were 
scabbed over. He’s been here long enough for those to heal, 
she thought, but held her tongue, afraid if she interrupted 
he would stop talking altogether. “When | got up, she was 
standing over me,” Ron continued. “I thought she was trying 
to help. | told her | was okay, and she smiled, and then ...” 
He glanced down at the girl on his lap for a moment, then 
went on. “I swear, honest, her stomach split right open, and 
there was this big metal thing that came out of it, and—” He 
shook his head. “She’s not going to believe us.” 

“Did the thing grab you and pull you inside?” Jessica 
asked softly, and he looked up at her in surprise. 

“Yeah,” he said. “Did she get you, too?” he asked. 

“No, but I’ve seen it happen,” she said half-truthfully. 
“Then what?” 

“| don’t know. Next thing | remember | woke up in here.” 

“What about her?” Jessica gestured to the girl on his lap. 
He shrugged, looking briefly embarrassed. 


“As soon as she woke up, she climbed onto my lap.” 

“Do you know her?” 

“You mean from before?” He looked down at the little girl 
again. 

“No, none of us Knew one another before,” Alanna said. 
Jessica looked at the little blond boy, and he looked away. 

“Okay, well listen,” Jessica said, and they all turned their 
eyes to her again. Creepy. Like I’m really a grown-up or 
something, she thought uneasily. She took a deep breath. 
“I’ve dealt with ... things like this before.” 

“Really?” Alanna was suddenly skeptical; Ron watched 
her warily. Lisa opened one eye, then pressed her face back 
into Ron’s shirt. 

“I’m not with them,” Jessica said hurriedly. “I’m locked in 
here with you because | got caught trying to find out more 
about them.” 

“Did you know about us?” Ron asked. 

“Not much, but I’m glad that | found you—everybody’s 
been looking for you. The people who took you, they’re 
trying to hurt a friend of mine—they already have hurt her— 
and | came here to stop them, to save her from them. Now 
that | know you’re here, I’m going to save you from them, 
too.” 

“You're locked in here, just like us,” Alanna said, this time 
like she believed it. Jessica suppressed a smile, momentarily 
amused. 

“| have friends out there, and they’re going to help, we’re 
going to get you out of this.” Alanna still looked suspicious, 
but Lisa was peeking at her from behind her hair, loosening 
her grip on Ron’s shirt for the first time. “I promise you, 
everything is going to be all right,” Jessica said with a surge 
of confidence. She looked at the children with calm 


determination, surprised to realize she had meant every 
word. 


“John! Charlie!” Carlton burst in to John’s apartment, the 
door hitting the wall as it swung open. 

Marla jumped, sitting up straight on the couch. “Carlton, 
what’s going on?” 

He didn’t respond, scanning the room. Marla was alone; 
she had the TV on at a low volume. The door to John’s room 
was closed, and he went to it. “No one’s here,” Marla said 
with a hint of disapproval, but Carlton rushed to look inside 
anyway. “John’s not here; neither is Charlie,” Marla called. 

“Well, | ran into one of them,” Carlton said grimly. “One 
of the Charlies, that is. The bad one. Where is John? Where's 
everyone?” 

“John and Charlie went somewhere; they seemed to be in 
a hurry and they wouldn’t say where they were going.” 

“Jessica?” 

“| haven’t seen her. She’s probably at home.” 

“| was just at her apartment, she’s not there.” Carlton 
stared at Marla, palpable dread rising between them. 
“Charlie—the other Charlie, | didn’t even hear her come in; 
She didn’t knock or anything. It was like she knew Jessica 
wouldn’t be there.” 

“Wait, shut up,” Marla said suddenly, pointing to the TV. 

“Marla, this is serious!” Carlton said with alarm. 

“Look at this; they’ve been playing this commercial all 
day.” Then the cartoonish face of a little girl, painted like a 
clown, filled the screen. 


“Come dressed as a clown and eat for free!” said a 
booming voice, then the camera cut to the front of a 
restaurant. 

“That—that’s her!” Carlton shouted. “I mean the sign, 
the girl on the sign, the clown girl thing!” Marla leaned 
forward, squinting at the screen. Carlton stopped, thoughtful 
fora moment. “She was taller, and a little attractive. It was 
really confusing; so many emotions.” 

“They've been playing these all day. New restaurant, 
animatronic characters ...” 

“It’s like the girl on the sign was all grown-up, and 
wanted to feed me pizza ...” He trailed off. 

“Carlton!” Marla yelled, snapping him back to the 
present. 

“You know where it is? The new place?” he asked. 

“Yes,” Marla announced. She flipped off the TV and stood. 
“Let’s go.” Carlton looked her grimly up and down, then took 
the other earpiece out of his pocket. 

“Put this in your ear,” he said. “It’s all we have; trust 
me.” 

“Okay.” Marla snatched the earpiece out of his hand on 
her way out the door. “I guess you'll fill me in on the way?” 
Carlton didn’t answer as he hurried after her, slamming the 
door behind them. 





As they drove through the ghost town, Charlie could feel 
John’s eyes on her. She had not spoken since they got in the 
car, and she was beginning to dread the moment she would 
have to speak again. John made a sharp turn, jostling the 
car, and she jerked forward in her seat, pressing into the 
seat belt. 


“Sorry,” John said sheepishly. Charlie eased back again. 

“It’s fine,” she said with a small smile. “I know this might 
be a strange time to ask, but, where is my car?” 

“I’m afraid your doppelganger has your car.” He eyed her 
nervously, and she forced a crooked smile and nodded. 

“What would that police report look like, | wonder?” she 
said lightly, and John grinned. 

John slowed to a stop, his expression fading. “This is it,” 
he said quietly. Charlie opened her door and got out. They 


were at the bottom of a hill; John had stopped beside a 
narrow archway with a small, metal star at its crest. At the 
top of the hill was a small house. 

“Okay, let’s get this over with,” Charlie said. She looked 
around nervously, half expecting someone to come running 
at them. “Let’s go.” 

As they climbed the hill, John looked several times like he 
wanted to say something, but did not. When they reached 
the front porch, Charlie put a hand on his arm. 

“So, she’s still in there?” she asked. “Jen, | mean.” 

He nodded. “Yeah. At least, | think so. Are you sure you 
want to do this?” 

“| have to.” 

“I'll go in first,” he offered. “I can... cover her up, if you 
want me to.” He looked at her, distressed. Charlie hesitated. 
“No,” she said finally, and grasped the knob firmly. The 

door wasn’t locked, and Charlie scanned the room 
apprehensively as she entered. The place was in disarray, 
everything blended into everything else, and at first nothing 
stood out. Then they saw her. 

There was a woman in the corner, by the hallway; she 
was huddled against the wall, curled over herself, and her 
dark hair hung thickly over her face. Charlie heard a sharp 
intake of breath, then realized it was her own. She held a 
hand out stiffly behind her, unable to say in words what she 
needed, but John saw, and took her hand, stepping close 
behind her. 

“That’s really her?” 

“Yeah,” he whispered. “Did you want to get closer?” John 
asked uncertainly. 

Charlie shook her head. “No. It’s not her anymore,” she 
whispered, turning away, closing it off in her mind. She took 


a deep breath. “Where did you find ... me?” She gestured to 
herself, to make sure John knew which Charlie she meant. 

“That way.” 

John led her to the hallway, keeping wide of Jen’s 
slumped body; Charlie forced herself not to look directly at 
her, allowing herself to see only a dark, hunched shape in 
the corner of her eye as she passed. At the end of the hall 
was the open door to a storage room, filled with trunks and 
cardboard boxes. The window was open, and it was not until 
she breathed fresh air that Charlie noticed the damp, moldy 
smell that had taken over the rest of the house. 

“This one,” John said. He was standing beside a large 
green trunk, its lid standing open. 

“In here?” Charlie said bleakly, stepping over several 
boxes to get to him. She peered inside: there was a small 
pillow, and nothing else. “I was just in there?” she asked, 
somehow disappointed. 

“Yeah. | mean, Jen must have had a reason. She must 
have known about the imposter. Maybe she put you there 
just before we arrived.” 

Charlie reached out and closed the trunk. “I want to look 
around.” 

“What are we looking for?” John asked, and she 
shrugged, opening another trunk. 

“Anything,” she said. “If there’s anything useful, this is 
where it will be. We need to know what we’re up against.” 

They searched in silence for a while. None of the boxes 
were labeled, and Charlie opened them haphazardly, sifting 
quickly through the ones containing paperwork, and setting 
aside the others unexamined. Those contained random 
assortments of household items—dishes and silverware, 
knickknacks Charlie recognized from childhood, even some 


of her old toys. She scanned a box of Jen’s tax documents 
carefully, then replaced them, finding nothing that seemed 
to stand out. She reached for another box, then saw John 
giving her a funny look. 

“What?” she asked. He smiled, and there was a hint of 
something sad beyond it. 

“You read really fast,” was all he said. 

“Didn't anyone ever teach you how to speed-read?” she 
said briefly, then turned her attention elsewhere. Charlie 
abandoned the stack of boxes she had been going through 
and went to the far corner of the room. She shoved a 
precarious pile of neatly folded sheets and towels aside, and 
sat down cross-legged on the carpet. From here, she could 
not even see John, though she could hear him, shuffling 
through paper and muttering to himself under his breath. 
She swept her eyes up and down the stacks, one after 
another, then she saw it: Henry, written in her aunt’s careful 
script. Charlie moved three overcoats and another box, and 
then it was in her hands. 

She stared at the lettering for a long moment. The ink 
had faded over the years. Charlie traced it with her index 
finger, her pulse fluttering in her throat like her heart was 
trying to get out. Daddy. She opened the box, and saw it— 
on top was an old, green plaid flannel shirt, worn down as 
thin and soft as cotton. She picked it up as if it were 
something delicate, and pressed it to her face, inhaling 
through the fiber. It only smelled like dust and time, but the 
touch of the fabric on her face brought tears to her eyes. 
She breathed in and out slowly, trying to force them back, 
and finally regained her composure, though part of her 
howled out the unfairness of it, that she could not even take 
a moment to cling to his slight presence, and mourn. Self- 


consciously, Charlie put the shirt over her shoulders, letting 
it drape over her back as she leaned once more over the 
box. The rest of the box was stacked with smaller boxes, 
and she opened the first one to find a framed picture of 
herself with Sammy, infants in those few, precious years 
before everything was ripped apart. Under the picture was 
an envelope, addressed in her father’s handwriting, to 
“Jenny.” Charlie smiled and shook her head. / can’t imagine 
anyone calling Aunt Jen, “Jenny.” She opened the letter. 


My Dearest Jenny, 

| had an entire list of instructions written out for you; 
schedules and timetables, keys and procedures. You have 
indulged me so much, and it’s only now, at the end, that 
| see how it has helped me get through these dark times, 
but also how ultimately empty it has been. | had 
everything so carefully planned; I’ve worked so tirelessly. 
I’ve warped and twisted my surroundings to the point 
where | can never be sure if I’ve completely settled back 
into reality, and even if | did manage to turn off 
everything planted in the walls to deceive myself, | think 
my mind would deceive me still. | don’t need clinical 
testing of the long-term effects of these devices to know 
that I’ve undoubtedly done permanent damage to 
myself. | will always see what | want to see, but worse 
than that, there is the splinter, more like the stake, 
always deep into my heart reminding me more and more 
every day that what | see Is a lie. Through your patience 
and your indulgence of me, you’ve tried to keep me 
happy, but it’s also somehow brought me back from this 
world I’ve made for myself. | think maybe it would have 
been better for you to have not indulged me; then | could 


have excluded you from my bubble, convinced myself 
that you were crazy like everyone else. But instead, your 
unceasing love caused me to listen to you, to let you in, 
and the consequence of that was seeing the truth in your 
eyes, and letting that in as well. 

| have my Charlie here with me. You will never have to 
indulge me in her again. Rather than taking joy in her, | 
have cried over her, so many countless tears. | have 
poured agony into her, until she serves as another 
reminder not of what | once had, but of the unbearable 
pain of what was taken from me. She has come to reflect 
my pain back to me; whereas |, for a time, took great 
comfort in her eyes, | now only see loss, endless, 
debilitating loss. Her eyes will never fill me again. In fact, 
they have emptied me. 

Keep all the closets shut. Let them be tombs for my 
denial and my grievance. My only lasting instruction for 
you concerns the fourth closet. It is not enough to keep it 
shut, you must keep that one sealed and buried. My grief 
was already beginning to waken me to reality when | 
began what was to be her final stage. When | rose, 
Slightly, from the depth of my despair, | saw that | had no 
choice but to cease my work, for | was only feeding my 
own delusion. My old faithful partner, who | can only 
hope now is in a grave of his own, took what | had begun, 
and made something of his own—something dreadful. He 
crafted my beloved work into something of his own, and 
endowed it with who knows what kinds of evil. | was able 
to stop him, and to seal away what he made, and you, 
Jenny, must ensure that the seal remains. 

| would instruct you to demolish the house if | could 
trust that it could be done effectively. Keep it, and make 


sure the world forgets it. Then, someday, after many 
decades have passed and no one remembers, fill it with 
every kind of flammable thing and burn it to the ground, 
standing close guard to put a bullet into anything that 
emerges from the rubble, no matter what, or who, it 
looks like. 

I’m going to be with my daughter. 


Love always &amp; to the end, 


Henry 


“Charlie?” John was standing behind her. Wordlessly, she 
held the pages out to him. He took them, and she moved 
aside the box the letter had been in and stared down at the 
next one. It was sealed with packing tape, but the sticky 
side was old and dry, the edges curling up from the 
cardboard. John shuffled the pages, still reading. Charlie 
shivered, despite the warm air, and she put her arms 
through the sleeves of her father’s shirt and rolled them up 
to her elbows. 

“Do you know what it means?” John asked quietly. Charlie 
looked up at him and shook her head. “Scoot over,” he said 
with a small smile, and she did, making room for him in the 
little soace among the boxes. He sat down facing her, 
crossing his legs awkwardly. He handed the pages back to 
her, and she scanned them again. “What did he mean about 
the closets?” John said. 

“| don’t know,” Charlie said drily. 

“Think,” John protested. “It has to mean something.” 

“! don’t know,” Charlie repeated. “You were there; they 
were always empty. Except the one with Ella.” 


“You don’t know that,” John said softly. “There was one 
that was locked,” he continued, almost to himself. 

“It doesn’t matter, does it?” Charlie said. “The house is 
gone. Unless you feel like digging through more rubble, this 
is all we have.” She pried the box with the peeling tape out 
of the larger box and handed it to him. All that was left 
under it was a lockbox, which opened easily when she 
tugged at the lid. It, too, was filled with papers: on top was a 
fine-pencil drawing of a familiar face. 

“That’s Ella,” John said, peering over her shoulder. 

“Yeah,” Charlie said. Her father had captured the doll’s 
delicate features in exquisite detail, not only her face but 
her shiny, synthetic hair, and the tiny creases in her dark, 
starched dress. Her eyes were open wide, and their blank 
stare was at odds with the rest of the picture: a perfectly 
lifelike representation of something lifeless. 

“Il didn’t realize he was such an artist,” John said, and 
Charlie smiled. 

“He said he drew things so he could see them, that it 
didn’t work the other way around.” She handed John the 
picture; below it was another, again of Ella, this time from 
the side. The next showed only Ella’s face, in profile. 

“He made Ella, right?” John asked, and Charlie tilted her 
head, considering the drawing. 

Charlie sorted through the rest of the pile more quickly 
and shook her head, confused. “They’re all of Ella.” 

John picked up the remaining cardboard box and ripped 
the tape off with sound like tearing cloth. It stuck to his 
fingers as he balled it up, and from the corner of her eye, 
Charlie saw him struggling to dislodge it. She paged through 
the drawings again. 


“Look at the notes.” She handed him the first drawing 
they had looked at, growing impatient as he peered at her 
father’s meticulous, but tiny handwriting. He read it out 
Slowly. 

“Height: 81 cm; Head circumference ...” He looked up. 
“It’s just measurements.” Charlie handed him another 
drawing. “Looks the same to me,” John said, then flicked his 
eyes to the notations. “Height: 118 cm.” John tilted the page 
as though he might be reading it wrong. 

“This one says 164.5,” Charlie said, holding up another, 
seemingly identical picture. “| don’t understand,” she said, 
setting the page in her lap. “Did he make another Ella?” She 
traced a finger along the line of Ella’s hair, smudging the 
pencil mark, then a thought struck her. “I wonder if he was 
trying to make it up to me,” she said. 

“What do you mean?” 

“If he was trying to give me ... a companion; a friend, 
because of what happened.” She met John’s eyes, unable to 
say what she really meant. 

“You mean Sammy? Because you lost your twin, he 
wanted to give you a doll that would ... what, grow up with 
you?” John said incredulously, and she nodded, relieved that 
he had made sense of her half-spoken words. 

“Maybe,” Charlie said softly. His eyes were pinched with 
worry, and he looked away, studying the drawings in his 
hands again. 

“It doesn’t really make sense, though, does it?” Charlie 
said. “What would | do with a five-and-a-half-foot doll on a 
track?” She reached for the letter again, holding it like a 
talisman though she did not need to read from it. “Was 
there a bigger version of Ella in the locked closet?” 


John’s eyes searched the air without a target in the silent 
room for several long moments, then snapped back to 
attention. Charlie was quietly looking down at her own hand, 
Slowly curling her fingers, then uncurling them. The silence 
dragged on, smothering, then John grabbed Charlie’s hand, 
Startling her. 

“| saw your blood.” 

“What?” Charlie said, startled. 

“| saw your blood that night. You bled. | don’t think Ella 
bleeds, do you?” The statement was absurd, but John was 
watching her uneasily, as if he expected a response. 
Seconds passed, and Charlie did not know what to Say. “1 
thought you were dead that night,” John whispered at last. 

“But I’m not dead, right?” She locked eyes with John. “I’m 
alive, right?” She took his hand, and he grasped hers tightly. 
He covered her hand in both his own, and she gave him a 
puzzled smile. “John?” she repeated nervously, and his jaw 
tightened. He looked on the point of speaking, when Charlie 
suddenly turned her head toward the window. 

“What is it?” John said with alarm. Charlie put a finger to 
her lips and tilted her head to listen. There’s someone 
outside. John watched her face intently, then his eyes 
widened as he registered the sound, too: the footsteps 
crunched one last time on gravel outside, then were silent. 

Around back, he mouthed, and Charlie nodded, dropping 
his hands and steadying herself on the trunk behind her as 
she stood. John hastened to help her, but she waved him 
off. 

“Come on,” she whispered. “Back door?” 

“Il don’t know.” He started to make his way toward the 
hall, motioning her to follow. “Charlie, hurry.” John had 
doubled back to her, and was pointing urgently to the door. 


She shoved the letter into her back pocket, and followed 
him, picking her way cautiously through the debris of the 
storage room. 

In the hallway, the thick and musty air hit like a wave, 
and Charlie swallowed her revulsion, trying not to picture 
her aunt’s body curled up in the next room. They crept 
down the hallway toward the front room, and the door, 
shuffling their feet so as to make no noise. At the end of the 
hall, Jonn stopped, and Charlie waited, listening. There was 
only silence, then a wind chime rattled outside the front 
door, and they pulled back into the recess of the hall. John 
looked grim. “There.” He nodded to the door opposite the 
storage room, which was slightly ajar. “Was that open 
before?” 

“Yes,” Charlie answered. “I mean, | think so.” They made 
their way slowly toward the open door: Charlie breathed 
shallowly, trying to register the slightest noise over the 
pounding of her own heart. As they reached the doorway, 
she heard a rustling, like someone stepping on soft leaves. 
John and Charlie split up and stood on either side of the 
doorway, Charlie by the hinges and John by the knob, and 
slowly, he pushed the door the rest of the way open. Charlie 
saw the relief on his face before she saw what was in the 
room: a bed, a dresser, and absolutely nothing else, not 
even a closet. There was a window open, and John turned 
back toward Charlie. “I think we’ve got a way out,” he said. 
She smiled back shakily. “Stay back while | check,” he 
whispered, and before she could answer, he had pushed the 
door farther open into the room, and was moving stealthily 
toward the open window, keeping in a straight line through 
the center of the room. Charlie stayed in the hall, pressing 
the door open so she could see the entirety of the room. 


Charlie watched nervously. Hurry, she urged him silently. 
Then as she thought it, she felt the door stop against her 
fingers as though something was blocking the way. /s there 
something behind the door? Slowly, noiselessly, she leaned 
to the side and put her eye to the crack in the door, along 
the hinges. Her heart stopped. 

Another eye was looking back at her. 

Charlie staggered back. The door wavered for a moment, 
then slammed shut. From inside the room something 
banged and crashed over and over against the wall. “John!” 
Charlie cried, and beat against the door. Suddenly, the 
house went still, and a few moments later the door drifted 
open and a figure glided out gracefully, stepping into the 
hall with care as though trying not to wake a sleeping baby. 
Charlie stared disbelievingly at her duplicate, her mind 
hazily registering all the tiny differences between them as 
she struggled for words. 

“You're not me,” Charlie managed to say, and her own 
face smiled cruelly back at her. 

“I’m the only you that matters.” 





Is it working?” Marla asked, nervously tapping the device in 
her ear. Carlton sped up the car. 

“Mine worked,” he said brusquely. He glanced at her; she 
was kneading her hands together, her knuckles going white. 
“I mean, you can’t rea/l/y tell if it’s working until ...” 

“Until what?” Marla said. 

“Well, until you’re in danger, and...” 

“And what?” Marla seemed impatient. 

“And you don’t die.” Carlton nodded reassuringly. 

“So how do we know if they’re not working?” Marla’s 
voice had lost its energy. 

“Well, if it doesn’t work, you won’t have to worry about it 
for long.” He smiled. 

“Right.” Marla stopped fidgeting with the device and put 
her hand in her lap. 


“It will work. | rewired yours exactly like mine.” 

“I’m not usually in the thick of this stuff,” Marla said. “| 
come in afterward with hugs and Band-Aids. If this were a 
movie, I’d be the lame babysitter, not the action hero.” 
There was a hint of bitterness in her voice, and Carlton 
looked at her, surprised. 

“Carlton, the road!” 

He snapped his attention back to what he was doing and 
gave the wheel a controlled jerk. 

“Marla, I’ve seen you in the thick of this stuff—remember 
Freddy’s?” 

She gave a halfhearted nod. 

“And don’t dismiss the power of hugs and Band-Aids,” he 
added, slowing the car as the restaurant’s sign came into 
View: CIRCUS BABY’S PIZZA blazed out over the night, casting half 
the block in garish red light. “Can’t miss this,” Carlton 
remarked as they pulled into the parking lot. As soon as 
they were past the neon sign, its brilliant, witchy light faded 
into the background: the lot was stark and bare. 

“No one’s here. Are you sure about this?” Marla said 
urgently. 

“No, but | Know what | saw.” Carlton drove slowly toward 
the entrance, pointing toward the clown girl mascot leaning 
over the entryway sign. “And that is who attacked me.” 

They parked close to the building. Carlton stopped to 
rummage around in the trunk for a minute, coming up with 
two small flashlights. He flicked one on and off 
experimentally, then handed it to Marla. 

“Thanks,” she whispered. 

They started around the side of the building and Carlton 
swept his light along the wall, illuminating a row of tall, 


rectangular windows. The window surfaces were tinted so 
dark they could not see in, and the frames were smooth 
black metal, with nowhere to force an opening. Carlton 
shook his head, and gestured toward the back of the 
building. Marla nodded, gripping her flashlight like a lifeline. 

There was more parking behind the building, and the 
back wall was lined with trash cans, two Dumpsters sticking 
out on either side of a metal door. The only light came from 
a single, flickering orange bulb, set above the plain door like 
a decoration. 

“Looks like this is our way in,” Carlton whispered. 

“Look.” Marla shone her light down onto fresh prints in 
the mud, tracking close to the wall and leading up to the 
door. “Jessica?” Marla looked to Carlton. 

“Maybe.” 

Marla grabbed the door handle and pulled hard, but it 
didn’t budge. 

“1 don’t think we'll find another way in,” she whispered, 
and he grinned. 

“You think | didn’t come prepared?” Carlton said, slipping 
a flat leather case from his pocket. He held it out to her. 
“Hold this,” he said, and selected several thin strips of metal 
as she balanced the case for him. 

“Are those lockpicks?” Marla hissed. 

“If there’s one thing I’ve learned from watching my dad, 
it’s that lockpicking can be used for good,” Carlton said 
solemnly. He bent over the lock, trying to keep his head out 
of the way of the light, and slowly began to wriggle the lock 
picks into place. 

“Oh, whatever. You can’t pick a lock ... can you? Is it even 
legal to own these?” Marla asked. He looked back at her; 


she was holding the kit away from her body as if trying to 
disassociate herself from it. 

“It’s legal as long as you don’t pick any locks,” he said. 
“Now be quiet so | can pick this lock.” Marla looked around 
nervously, but didn’t say anything. He turned his attention 
back to the door, listening for the telltale clicks of the 
tumblers falling into place as he carefully made his way 
through the mechanism. 

“This is taking forever,” Marla whined. 

“| didn’t say | was good at this,” he said absently. “Got 
it!” He grinned, triumphant. 

The door opened with a creak, revealing a wide hallway 
with a gentle upward slope. The hall itself was dark, but a 
few yards ahead, they could see the dim glow of florescent 
lights. Marla pulled the door closed behind them, cushioning 
it with her hand so that it wouldn’t slam. The light was 
coming from an open door on the left side of the hall: they 
waited, but no sound came from its direction, and they 
started to move, hugging the wall. As they got closer, 
Carlton sniffed the air. “Shh,” Marla hissed, and he jerked 
his head toward the door. 

“Pizza,” he whispered. “Can’t you smell it?” Marla 
nodded, and impatiently waved him forward. 

“Of all the smells in this place, that’s the one that 
catches your attention?” The open door proved to be the 
kitchen, and they glanced around briefly, then Carlton went 
to a large refrigerator and pulled it open. 

“Carlton, forget the pizza!” Marla said in dismay, but the 
refrigerator held only racks of ingredients. Carlton closed 
the door. 

“You never know who could have been hiding in there,” 
he said quietly as they exited the kitchen. At the end of the 


hall was a swinging double door, with small windows just at 
Carlton’s eye height, and he surveyed what he could see of 
the next room, then pushed the door open. Marla gasped. 

“Creepy,” Carlton said mildly. The dining room in front of 
them was lit with the same dim, florescent light, giving the 
brand-new place an odd dullness. There were tables and 
chairs at the center, and arcade games and play areas 
along all the walls, but their eyes were drawn immediately 
to the small stage at the back corner. Its purple curtain was 
pulled open, and it was empty, except for a bright yellow 
rope strung across the front and a sign with a picture of a 
clock on it. NEXT SHOow: it read in neat, handwritten letters, but 
the clock had no hands. Marla shivered, and Carlton nudged 
her. “It’s not the same,” he whispered. 

“It’s exactly the same,” she said. Carlton looked around 
at the rest of the room, his eyes lighting on a ball pit that 
stuck out from the front wall in a half circle, a round red 
plastic awning arcing over it, trimmed with white. 

“Look at the monkey bars.” She pointed. Across the 
room, three small children steadily climbed the tangled 
structure of red and yellow bars. Carlton, startled, looked at 
Marla with surprise, then ran to them. 

“Are you Okay? Where are your parents?” he asked 
breathlessly, then his mouth went dry. The children were not 
human, or alive. Their animatronic faces were painted like 
clowns, their features absurdly exaggerated: One had a 
round, red nose that covered half its face and a white wig of 
synthetic curls; another had a molded smile on its face and 
a painted red grimace. The third, a red-cheeked, smiling 
clown with a rainbow-colored wig, looked almost cute, 
except for the gigantic spring that replaced the middle of its 


torso, boinging up and down each time it moved. All of them 
had black eyes, with no iris or pupil, and they did not appear 
to see Carlton. He waved his hands, but they did not turn 
their heads, just kept grasping the bars with their pudgy 
hands, and pulling themselves along the structure with 
uncanny precision. All of them emitted a loud whirring 
sound, as if they were wind-up toys that had been set loose 
to climb. The child with the spring suddenly flung its top half 
over the top of the bars, the spring extending into a long, 
wavy wire, then it grabbed a bar, and its feet shot into the 
air wildly, and came snapping back into place on the other 
side. 

“My mistake, you’re not the kids we’re looking for, carry 
on,” Carlton whispered shakily, as the creatures continued, 
weaving over and under, back and forth through the 
structure. “They don’t see us,” Marla whispered, and it took 
him a moment to register her voice. 

“What?” he said, his eyes still on the clown-children. 

“They don’t see us,” she repeated. “These little things 
are working.” She tapped her ear. 

“Right, good,” Carlton said, pulling himself away from the 
scene. Marla was smiling with relief. “We still have to be 
careful, though,” he warned. “I can’t guarantee it works on 
everything, and it definitely won’t work on people.” 

Marla shivered, then nodded quickly. “There’s a room 
past the stage,” she said. 

“Looks like an arcade,” Carlton said grimly. 

Marla slowed by the stage, her hand drifting toward the 
curtain as if she might try to look behind it. “No.” Carlton 
grabbed Marla’s hand. “The last thing we want to do is call 
any attention to ourselves.” Marla nodded in agreement. 


The arcade smelled overpoweringly of new plastic, the 
games gleaming and scarcely played. There were a dozen or 
so freestanding arcade cabinets, and two pinball machines, 
one—predictably, by now—clown-themed, and the other 
painted with cartoonish snake charmers. Carlton gave them 
a wide berth. Marla caught his sleeve and gestured to a 
closed door on the wall to their left, an Exit sign glowing red 
above it, and he nodded. They headed for it, creeping past a 
“test your strength” game, governed by an adult-size clown 
with a face made of jagged metal plates who nodded 
continuously, its painted smile maniacal. As they passed 
Carlton watched it carefully, but its eyes did not seem to 
track their movements. When they reached the door, 
Carlton took a deep breath, then gently pushed on the bar. 
It gave way immediately, and Marla sighed with relief. 
Carlton pushed the door open, holding it out for her, then 
froze as the unmistakable clack of servos broke the silence 
behind them. 

They both spun around; Carlton braced his arm in front of 
Marla’s chest protectively, his heart racing, but nothing was 
moving. He scanned the room, then saw it: the clown 
standing over the game was staring at them, its head 
cocked to the side. Carlton glanced at Marla, and she 
nodded minutely: she had seen it, too. Slowly, she backed 
through the door, as Carlton watched the animatronic, but it 
showed no further signs of movement. When Marla was 
safely through the door, Carlton waved his arms, hoping 
desperately that it would not see him. The clown remained 
motionless, having apparently returned to stasis. Carlton 
Slipped out of the room and closed the door carefully behind 
him. He turned, and almost fell over Marla, who was backed 


up almost to the wall. “Watch it,” he whispered good- 
naturedly, catching her shoulder for balance. 

Then he looked up, and swayed on his feet, disoriented 
by a dozen distorted, menacing figures. He took a breath, 
and the room fell into place: mirrors. Before them was an 
array of funhouse mirrors, each one distorting the images it 
reflected. Carlton’s eyes flitted from one to the next—one 
showed him and Marla as tall as the ceiling; in the next they 
were blown up like balloons, crowding each other out of the 
frame; in the next their bodies looked normal, but their 
heads shrank to stalks an inch wide. 

“Okay, then,” he whispered. “How do we get out of 
here?” 

As if in answer to his question, two mirrors slowly began 
to swivel, turning toward each other until they had made a 
narrow door in the wall of close-set panels. Beyond the 
small opening lay more mirrors, but Carlton could not tell 
how many there were, or which way they were directed, as 
one mirror caught another, doubling the reflections until it 
was impossible to see what was real and what was not. 
Marla stepped through the gap and beckoned: there was a 
gleam in her eye, but Carlton couldn’t tell if it was 
excitement, or the strange, dim light. He followed her, and 
as soon as he was through the gap the panels began to 
pivot again, closing them inside. Carlton glanced around, 
growing nervous now that their exit had been blocked off. 
They seemed to be in a narrow corridor that branched off in 
two directions, the walls made of more floor-to-ceiling mirror 
panels. 

“It’s a maze,” Marla whispered, and gave him a smile 
when she saw the look on his face. “Don’t worry,” she 
added. “I’m good at mazes.” 


“You're good at mazes?” Carlton said with irritation. 
“What is that supposed to mean? /’m good at mazes.” 

“What's wrong with saying that? I’ve always been good 
with mazes.” Marla shook her head. 

“What, like the hay maze? When we were five? Is that 
what you’re talking about?” 

“Il got through it before anyone else did.” 

“You climbed over the top of the bales. You’re not 
Supposed to do that.” 

“Oh, you’re right.” Marla’s face flushed. “I’m not good at 
mazes.” 

“We will get through this together.” Carlton took her 
hand, long enough to stop her from having a panic attack, 
then released it. 

She looked in both directions, thoughtful, then pointed 
decisively. “Let’s try that way,” she said. They started down 
the path she had chosen, and Carlton followed, keeping his 
eyes on her feet in front of him. After only a few steps he 
heard her sharp intake of breath, and snapped his head up: 
they were at a dead end. 

“Dead end already?” he said, surprised. 

“No, the panel closed,” she hissed. 

“This way, hay maze,” Carlton said with a hint of 
amusement. “Back this way.” 

They started back the way they had come, and this time 
Carlton saw the panels move: as they moved back to the 
spot where they had come in, a panel swung toward them, 
cutting off their path. A second later, another panel swung 
away, opening a new corridor. Marla hesitated, and Carlton 
stepped up beside her. “No choice, let’s go,” he said. She 
nodded, and they walked deeper into the maze. 


As soon as they had crossed the new threshold, the panel 
swung shut. They looked around for the new opening, but 
there was none: they were enclosed on all sides by mirrors. 
Carlton walked the small perimeter quickly, beginning to 
panic. 

“Carlton, just wait, another one will open,” Marla 
whispered. 

“| kn-ow you're in h-ere.” An unfamiliar voice rang out. It 
seemed to come from everywhere at once, echoing like it 
was bouncing from panel to panel. The sound was 
mechanical, glitching out midword. They exchanged a 
glance: Marla’s face was pale with fear. 

“There!” Carlton pointed. A panel had opened while they 
were distracted. He rushed for it, and walked into a mirror, 
smacking his head on the glass. “Ow.” 

“It’s there,” Marla hissed, pointing to the opposite side of 
the enclosure. 

The panel began to swing shut, closing the room off 
again. 

“ll f-ind you ...” The glitching voice had a strange, 
unsteady tone. 

“Carlton!” Marla stood in the gap, holding out a hand, 
and he ran for her, both of them making it through just as 
the panel rotated back to its position. 

“What were you going to do, stand there and let it crush 
you?” Carlton hissed. 

“| hadn’t considered we could get caught between the 
panels. This place is just asking for a lawsuit.” Marla 
straightened herself. “It’s been a lovely evening, but | think 
I'd like you to take me home now,” she said calmly. 

“Take you home? Take me home!” Carlton said before 
pausing to listen. 


“| know j-ust where you a-re ...” 

They were in a hallway again, this one with two corners 
to choose from. They exchanged a grim look and turned to 
the left, moving slowly. Carlton kept his eyes on Marla’s 
shoes ahead of him, trying not to look at the walls on either 
side, where ranks of their duplicates marched silently beside 
them, misshapen and warped in the mirrors, then, 
occasionally, appearing normal. When they reached the 
corner, something flashed in the corner of his eye, a 
reflection of a reflection of giant eyes, staring at them. 
Carlton grabbed Marla’s shoulder. 

“Over there!” She shuddered. 

“| saw it, too.” 

“Come on, go, go, go,” Marla whispered. “Just follow me. 
Stay calm; remember, nothing can see us.” 

“I’m getting clo-ser ...” The mechanical voice echoed 
through the chamber. 

“It’s just a recording,” Carlton whispered. “It’s coming 
from everywhere, | don’t think there is anything actually in 
here with us.” Marla nodded, looking unconvinced. A few 
steps ahead of them, panels began to pivot again, closing 
off their path: Carlton glanced behind them—the other end 
of the hall had closed, too. Marla inched closer to him. 

“| see you...” 

“Shut up,” Carlton whispered. He tried to slow his 
breathing so it made no sound, imagining the air going in 
and out, filling his lungs without touching the sides. The 
panel to their right began to swing open slowly, and they 
backed out of its way. Marla gasped, and Carlton grabbed 
her arm, seeing it: there was something behind the slowly 
opening mirror, though he couldn’t make out what. They 
backed up farther, taking small, cautious steps. Carlton 


searched the mirrored panels for an exit, but saw only his 
own face, bulging and deformed. 

“There you are...” 

The panel opened, revealing a kaleidoscope of purple, 
white, and silver, glancing off every mirror disjointedly. 
Carlton blinked, trying to make sense of the reflections, then 
a figure at the center stepped into the makeshift room. 

He was a bear, built like Freddy Fazbear, and yet entirely 
unlike him: his metal body was gleaming white, accented 
with vibrant purple. He held a microphone in his hand, the 
top sparkling like a disco ball, and on his chest, at the center 
of a purple metal shirtfront, was a small, round speaker. 
Only a few feet from them, the new Freddy turned his 
massive head from side to side, his eyes passing over them. 
Carlton glanced at Marla, who tapped her ear and nodded. 
He put his finger to his lips. Freddy took two steps forward, 
and they stepped back, pressing against the wall. Freddy 
looked from side to side again. 

“| kn-ow just wh-ere you are...” The sound was 
earsplitting, rattling Carlton’s teeth, but Freddy’s mouth did 
not move—the voice was projecting from the speaker in his 
chest. 

Carlton held his breath as the bear’s eyes passed over 
him, reminding himself that he was masked, but the bear’s 
eyes hesitated on him before moving away. Carlton could 
feel the sweat beading on his forehead. 

The wall behind them repositioned, and Carlton shifted 
his weight just in time not to fall, Marla moving just behind 
him. The panel swung open slowly, and they edged away as 
Freddy walked slowly in their direction, heading for the new 
exit—where they were now standing. Marla touched 
Carlton’s arm, guiding him to the side just as Freddy 


lumbered past them, his shiny surface almost brushing 
against Carlton’s nose. 

“I’m get-ing closer,” Freddy stuttered menacingly as he 
disappeared around a corner. The panel began to swing 
shut, and Marla pointed urgently to the door Freddy had 
come in. They raced for it, making it through just before the 
mirrors closed. 

Carlton and Marla stared at each other, gasping as if 
they’d run miles. “Was that Freddy?” she whispered. He 
shook his head. 

“I don’t know, but he was different,” Carlton said. 

“What? Different from what?” 

“The other animatronics we’ve seen so far. He was... 
looking at me,” Carlton said uncomfortably. 

“They’re all looking at us.” 

“No, he was looking at me.” 

“I can hear you; come on out!” Freddy called out as if on 
cue. His voice echoed through the maze of mirrors, as 
impossible to locate as it had been before. Carlton took a 
deep, steadying breath. 

“How are we supposed to get out of here?” he whispered, 
trying to sound calmer than he felt. “Where even are we?” 

“There, that light.” Marla pointed over their heads at the 
rafters above them, where a red stage light beamed down 
over the entirety of the maze. 

“What?” 

“| saw that light when we first came in, but it must have 
been at least twenty feet away, now it’s right over our 
heads. We just have to keep moving away from it now,” she 
said confidently. Carlton studied the ceiling for a moment, 
considering what she'd said. 


“Il told you; I’m good at mazes.” She winked. “We just 
have to wait for the right panels to open.” She pointed 
toward a specific panel. 

“That could take ages,” Carlton said despairingly. 

“It will take longer if we don’t keep track of what 
direction we’re going in,” Marla said. “Come on.” She set off 
down the path she had indicated, and Carlton followed close 
behind. 

“I’m getting clo-ser ...” Freddy’s voice resounded through 
the maze. 

“That sounded like it was behind us again. He’s coming 
around,” Carlton whispered. 

“Okay, okay. Then we go around, too.” 

“Just get us out,” he said quietly. Marla nodded, and they 
walked cautiously onward, flanked by their various, 
distorted duplicates. 

The pivoting panels forced them nearly in a circle before 
giving them a choice of direction, and Marla leaped on the 
chance, grabbing Carlton by the hand and almost running 
down the passage until they were stopped again, and made 
to turn. 

“Shh,” Carlton hissed frantically. 

Marla pushed experimentally on the side of one of the 
panels, but it didn’t budge; Carlton stepped up to help, 
throwing his full weight against the mirror, but even under 
their combined force, it would not turn. “I don’t know why | 
thought that would work,” Marla whispered. 

“I’ve almost g-ot you ...” Freddy intoned. Marla looked 
around uncertainly. 

“I’ve got a really terrible idea,” Carlton said slowly. Marla 
gave him a warning look. “Are you still keeping track of 
where we are? Or at least, the direction that we should go?” 


“| think so,” she said, scanning the rafters again, a look 
of comprehension dawning on her face. 

“Close enough,” he said. 

“What are you going to do?” Marla asked, sounding like 
she already regretted it. Carlton took the flashlight out of his 
pocket and made a fist around it, wound up his arm, and 
smashed the butt of the light into the mirror in front of 
them. The glass shattered with a high, clear noise, and a 
dull pain reverberated up his arm. 

“I can h-ear you in th-ere ...” Freddy’s voice sputtered 
from all around them. 

“Does he just say that, or did he actually hear that?” 
Marla said. 

The panel with the broken mirror swung open, but before 
they could move there was a rushing sound of heavy 
footsteps and crunching glass shards. Carlton held his 
breath, and nodded to Marla. Freddy stepped into the room 
with forceful steps, then immediately stopped in the center, 
his upper body slowly turning to scan the surroundings. 
Carlton and Marla crept around the glass shards, and snuck 
through the open panel behind the animatronic. In the 
corridor, Carlton looked questioningly at Marla, and she 
pointed. He nodded, strode to the farthest mirror, and 
Smashed it. 

In an instant, Freddy pivoted toward them. The wide- 
eyed face turned from side to side. After a moment, another 
panel began to open beyond the freshly broken mirror. 
Carlton and Marla ran for it, the glass breaking beneath 
their feet. “There!” Marla yelled. 

Carlton looked up and could see an exit sign above a 
door, just a few yards from where they stood. Marla caught 


Carlton’s eye and mouthed, We’re a/most there. 

“Come back here!” said Freddy’s maniacal voice, and 
then they all stepped out into the last passage: a jauntily 
painted ticket booth was visible, and beyond that, an open 
wall. Marla and Carlton exchanged a glance, and cautiously 
sped up. “Got you,” Freddy said. The speaker was right 
behind Carlton’s head, and Carlton startled, tripping over his 
own feet. 

He righted himself with a palm on the mirror, then took 
off after Marla, and ran straight into his own reflection, 
hitting his face on the glass. “Marla, wait!” he screamed: he 
could see her reflected in three mirrors, but was still unsure 
of where she had actually gone. “Wait.” He rubbed his 
forehead, and looked into the nearest mirror, trying to see if 
he was bleeding. He was not, but something was wrong. It 
took him a second to realize that his earpiece had been 
knocked loose. He looked around in panic, when suddenly 
Freddy loomed behind him in the mirror. 

Carlton froze in place; the massive white-and-purple 
bear’s head was staring at him from the mirror, looming 
over his shoulder. He looked down and saw the earpiece at 
his feet, in one swift motion he leaned down to grab it. His 
hands were shaking, and he struggled to get it back into his 
ear. When he looked up, Freddy was standing over him, and 
Carlton was lifted off his feet with a sudden, painful force. 
Carlton jerked and dropped back to the ground, the earpiece 
falling beside him. 

Freddy drew back and stared at Carlton for a moment, his 
eyes clicking back and forth, and his mouth opened just 
enough to reveal two long rows of perfectly polished white 
teeth. Carlton leaped toward the earpiece on the ground 
just as Freddy’s arm shot out and shattered another glass 


panel. Carlton hit the wall headfirst with a bang, and 
recoiled in pain. 

Freddy turned his head, first from side to side, then all 
the way around to face backward, his eyes searching wildly. 
Carlton scanned the ground in a panic, and saw the 
earpiece again, but it was in three places, in three mirrors. 
The glass crunched again nearby, but Carlton kept his eyes 
on the earpieces, switching from one to another in a 
desperate attempt to see which one was real. Suddenly, a 
human hand reached down and grabbed the earpiece in 
each of the three panels. 

“Carlton!” Marla called, and he turned toward the sound 
and saw her, not a reflection but the real Marla as she threw 
the earpiece to him. Carlton snatched the earpiece out of 
the air, and shoved it into his ear. Freddy stopped in place, 
his arms still outstretched. Carlton didn’t dare move, though 
the microphone was inches from his face. In his peripheral 
vision he could see Marla inching toward a door with exit 
over it. Freddy turned his head from side to side again as he 
Slowly straightened from his attacking posture. 

“I'll f-ind you ...” came the voice from his chest, and he 
lowered his arms. Marla turned the doorknob, and pushed 
the door slowly open, just enough to see that it was 
unlocked. Scarcely breathing, Carlton backed away from 
Freddy, keeping his eyes on the animatronic until he was 
beside Marla. 

In one fluid motion, she eased open the door, they darted 
through it, then shoved it closed behind them. There was a 
deadbolt near the top, and Carlton flipped it, put his ear to 
the crack. There was nothing but silence from the other 
side, and he turned to Marla and heaved a sigh, light- 


headed with relief. They were in a dark hall, completely free 
of mirrors. 

“Dark, scary hallway,” Marla muttered. 

“It’s beautiful,” Carlton said. 

A scream ripped through the air from somewhere nearby, 
and they both froze. 

“Not finished yet,” Carlton said, and took off running 
toward the sound, Marla close at his heels. 





Everyone, be very quiet,” Jessica whispered. The children 
just stared at her, their eyes wide and solemn. They stood 
together in the back corner of the small, dank room, 
awaiting her instructions: Three-year-old Lisa was still 
huddled behind Ron, her chosen protector, and Alanna had 
taken hold of the little blond boy’s hand, though he was 
wriggling in her grasp. Jessica swallowed. Why do / have to 
be the leader? It’s bad enough when I’m just in charge of 
myself. 

She bent down to the children’s level, trying to summon 
some kind of leadership quality. Should have listened to 
Mom. Should have played a team sport. But no, | had to be 
the quiet girl in the corner chewing the eraser off her pencil. 

Jessica studied the door again, then took a more serious 
tone. “Is there something out there?” Alanna and Ron 


exchanged a worried glance. “What’s outside? You can tell 
me,” Jessica pleaded. 

“It comes in through the door,” Alanna said, not meeting 
Jessica’s eyes. “She ...” The little girl broke off and covered 
her face, mumbling something unintelligible behind the 
mask of her hands. 

“She? Who, the ... woman who took you?” Jessica asked 
gently, trying to contain her impatience. Alanna shook her 
head vigorously, her face still hidden. 

“We thought it was a toy. It wasn’t scary like everything 
else.” Ron searched for words, and Lisa tugged on his shirt 
and whispered something, too quietly for Jessica to make 
out. Ron nudged her. “Tell her.” Lisa looked up at Jessica 
with a suspicious expression on her grubby toddler’s face. 

“She’s all mangled up,” the girl said, then turned away 
again, hiding her face in Ron’s shirt. He gave Jessica a 
distressed look. 

“Who? Who’s all mangled up?” Jessica said slowly, 
searching her mind for what they might be talking about. 
“Was something broken? Did you break one of them?” she 
asked hopefully. The little kids all began to sniffle again, and 
she ground her teeth. “What is it?” Jessica nearly snapped, 
but none of them seemed to notice her tone. 

“It’s not broken,” Ron said, his voice rising in panic, and 
then the floor shook with a resounding thud. Alanna 
grabbed Jessica around the waist, and Ron huddled closer, 
pulling Lisa with him. The little blond boy stayed where he 
was, frozen in place with a look of terror. There was another 
thud, this time louder, then the pounding continued over 
and over, coming closer. Jessica could hear it moving in the 
hall, reverberating deep in her chest as whatever it was 
came thundering toward the door outside. She heard wood 


cracking, and clutched the children’s shoulders as 
something struck the wall three times in quick succession, 
rocking them all back. There was a final, clattering noise 
that seemed to come from all around. 

“What is that?” Jessica whispered, searching the walls 
and ceiling, unable to make sense of the noises. Then 
everything fell silent. They waited. Jessica listened, counting 
to ten, then twenty, and the sound did not come again. She 
counted to thirty, then sixty. / have to do something. She 
straightened, carefully extracting herself from Alanna’s 
grasp. “Wait here,” she whispered. She crept toward the 
door, stepping as softly as she could; as she moved she 
could feel their eyes on her. The door was ordinary-looking, 
a wooden door with a brass knob—the kind you’d see ona 
closet. Jessica took a quick, deep breath, then stretched out 
her arm to take the knob. 

Before she could touch it, the knob turned, and the door 
began to slide open. Jessica held her breath, and took 
steady steps backward, desperately wanting to rejoin the 
group, even if they were just children. At first, Jessica saw 
only pink and white, the shapes indistinct, then her mind 
made sense of it: slowly, the enormous head of a garishly 
painted fox peered into the room. 

Foxy? Jessica thought, hazily taking in pointed pink ears 
and yellow eyes. Its cheeks were painted with red circles, 
like the animatronic girl’s had been. The creature looked at 
her for a long moment, and she stared back, unable to 
remember how to move her feet, and then the fox head 
retreated, and all the children screamed. Something new 
sprang violently into the room, a long and segmented metal 
limb like a spider’s leg. It braced against the floor just as a 
second metal leg violently invaded the space, embedding 


itself in the nearest wall. The children screamed, and Jessica 
raced toward them, looking frantically for a way out. The 
room was filling with arms and legs, extended and 
contorted, some with hands, others without. Jessica 
searched for a place to run through the steadily thickening 
mass of legs. Her eyes met the yellow eyes of the fox head, 
now suspended in the air by rods and beams. But there was 
another set of eyes as well. Does it have two heads? The 
unskinned metal skull lowered itself; it was connected to the 
mass above by cables and cords, and seemed to move of its 
own will. 

One high-pitched scream rose above the others, a blood- 
curdling wail. “LISA!” Ron cried, and Jessica saw that the 
thing had one hand on the little girl’s arm and was pulling 
her toward it. The skinless metal head studied her, then 
swiveled and swung on its cables to the others, taking an 
aggressive stance toward them as the metal limbs 
entangled the little girl and pulled her toward the door. 

“NO!” Jessica cried, climbing through the snares of metal 
coils and grabbing Lisa’s tiny hand. A violent surge threw 
her back, but she held fast to whatever she had managed to 
grasp, letting go only as she hit the floor. She struggled for 
air as she got to her feet, but the creature had already 
retreated through the doorway and disappeared. Jessica 
whirled, looking frantically to the children, and her heart 
nearly burst with relief: Lisa was on the ground beside her, 
and Ron and Alanna were helping her up. Jessica rushed to 
them. “It’s okay,” she whispered, then the momentary relief 
vanished. The blond boy, the one who might have been 
Jacob, was gone. 

“1 couldn’t hold on to him,” Alanna wailed, as if reading 
Jessica’s mind. 


Jessica looked to the door in despair, but quickly steadied 
herself. “We'll get him back,” Jessica said, because it was all 
she could think of to say. She glanced around helplessly, 
then froze as the doorknob slowly began to turn again. 
“Stay here,” Jessica said in a low voice, and she moved 
quickly to the door. She stood to the side, bracing herself to 
jump on whatever came through. This is your plan? 

The door opened, and Jessica screamed and lunged into 
the doorway, as though ready to karate-chop whatever was 
coming through. 

Carlton and Marla jumped back with startled expressions, 
and Jessica stared for a moment, then seized Carlton in a 
hug, holding tight to his shoulders as if he could stop her 
from shaking. 

“Jessica?” Marla said, spotting the children. Jessica 
pushed Carlton away. 

“Something got one of the kids, a little boy,” she said in 
a rush. “I didn’t see where it went.” 

Marla was already beside the children, checking them for 
injury. “We have to get them out,” she said. 

“Oh, really, Marla? Is that what we should be doing? Here 
| was painting my nails,” Jessica said crisply. Carlton reached 
for his ear and pulled something out. 

“Here, take this,” he said. 

“What? Ew.” Jessica made a face instinctively, then 
peered at the tiny device. “Is that a hearing aid?” 

“Not exactly. It makes you invisible to the animatronics. 
You and Marla take these kids out, I’ll find the other kid they 
took.” 

“How does it—?” Jessica took the device and studied it. “| 
have to put it in my ear?” 

“Yes! You have to put it in your ear! I'll explain later.” 


“But, are your ears even clean?” She leaned in, peering 
suspiciously at Carlton’s ear. Marla grabbed the earpiece out 
of her hand and shoved it into Jessica’s ear. 

“OW!” Jessica cried. 

Marla turned back to the kids. “Shouldn’t we give them 
to the children, instead?” 

“There are only two earpieces, and you can both protect 
them better if you’re invisible, right?” Carlton said irritably. 

“What if Jess and | stay here with the kids, and you take 
one out at a time, wearing the earpieces?” Marla pressed. 
Jessica shook her head immediately. 

“And what if that thing comes back and kills us all while 
we’re waiting for Carlton to take his sweet time? We have to 
make a break for it, Marla, it’s the only way.” 

They were all quiet for a moment. Carlton looked from 
Jessica to Marla and back. 

“Right? Now, give me thirty seconds to get away from 
here, that way if something chases me, | can draw them 
away from you. Anything | should know?” Carlton paused at 
the door. 

“Afton’s still alive,” Jessica said, and he nodded. 

“This ends today,” he said quietly. “One way or another. 
Not one more child dies because of that psychopath. | owe 
that much to Michael.” 

Jessica bit her lip. “We all do,” she said. 

He forced a smile. “Good luck.” 

“Good luck,” she echoed. 

“Right.” Carlton clenched his jaw, then squared his 
shoulders and held the door open, poised to exit. “This was 
my idea?” he muttered, then closed the door behind him. 

“Marla, do you know the way out?” Jessica asked, 
surprised to hear her own voice come out clear and steady. 


Marla nodded, standing up. 

“We came in the back way. But | think if we go back down 
that hall, we can get out into the main dining room; should 
be easy to get out from there, right?” 

“You'd think so,” Jessica muttered with an edge. 

Marla gave her a level look. “You got something better?” 

“No. | don’t.” Jessica turned to the three remaining 
children, who were watching them with wide eyes. “We 
don’t have to get far,” she said, searching for scraps of hope 
to offer them. “I need you to stay together, and stay with 
me and Marla. If you can do that, we’ll all be okay.” They 
looked at her like they knew she was lying, but no one said 
a word. 

Jessica opened the door again carefully. The hallway 
outside the little room was dark, but Marla led them onward 
as if she really did know where they were headed. She held 
a large, battered flashlight out in front of her. She looked 
poised to turn it on but refrained from doing so, seemingly 
afraid of attracting more unwanted attention. Jessica’s eyes 
adjusted to the dim light as she took up the rear, alert to the 
Slightest sign of danger. 

They came to aT in the hall, and Marla turned without 
hesitation. A few yards ahead there was light: strings of 
Small, bare bulbs lit the way at intervals, and the next fork 
in the hall was visible. We’re getting closer, Jessica thought, 
as they moved cautiously onward. 

A soft popping noise caught Jessica’s attention overhead, 
and she froze. “Marla,” she hissed, and Marla and the 
children ahead stopped and turned around. Marla pointed 
up with a worried expression, and Jessica looked up to see 
that some of the bulbs over her head had gone out, their 


glass made opaque with a sooty film. “Just old lights,” 
Jessica breathed. 

A light above Marla burst and died, and all of them 
jumped. Alanna clapped both hands over her mouth, and 
Ron put a hand on Lisa’s shoulder. “Can we go faster?” Lisa 
whispered. All at once, the rest of the light bulbs flickered 
and clattered. Jessica held her breath: they stayed on, 
preserving the little light, but overhead something hollow 
and metallic rattled in the ceiling. 

Marla’s face went pale. “Keep moving,” she said tightly. 
Jessica gave a sharp nod. The rattling noise kept pace, 
sometimes seeming to come from above them, and 
sometimes from the dark corners just out of view, scraping 
and clattering in a vent or crawl space. Lisa whimpered; the 
older children’s faces were stony, but Jessica could see the 
glimmer of tears on their cheeks. Suddenly, Marla stopped 
Short, and Jessica almost bumped into Ron. “What?” she 
hissed, then saw: a thin curtain of dust was falling from 
above. Jessica looked up, and saw the open duct directly 
above them. 

A multisegmented metal arm covered with springs and 
wires dropped down through the open duct, anchoring itself 
to the floor right next to Jessica’s foot. Everyone screamed. 
The arm retracted, then two more of the creature’s 
contorted limbs smashed down to the ground, raining down 
plaster and dust. “RUN!” Marla screamed. They took off 
down the hallway as the creature lowered its full form into 
the space, its shiny white fox head turning and smiling in 
their direction as they fled. Jessica glanced back, and the 
unskinned head dropped, too, grinning upside down, a red 
bow tie joining their necks ridiculously. Jessica fled; behind 
her came an enormous thud. Run faster! she wanted to 


scream, but the others were gasping for breath, already 
running at their full capacity. 

The children were pounding along as fast as they could, 
but Lisa, the smallest, began to fall behind. The creature 
shot past Jessica, reaching out for the little girl again, and 
Jessica grabbed her, yanking her up and out of reach just in 
time. It reared back to strike again, and Jessica clutched Lisa 
to her chest and ran on. They rounded a corner, and with a 
flare of hope Jessica saw that the hall was short, ending ina 
heavy set of double doors. Marla sped up, and Alanna and 
Ron did the same; Jessica kept her pace, staying at the back 
as Lisa clung to her with startling strength. 

Marla reached the end of the hall and slammed herself 
against the emergency bar, and the doors split open. They 
raced through, and Marla flung the door shut, grabbing a 
nearby sign post and jamming it through the door handles. 

“Keep running,” Jessica said with a fresh pump of 
adrenaline. She looked around: they were up against the 
wall, behind a popcorn popper and a cotton candy machine. 
She glanced back briefly at the sign Marla had barred the 
door with: LET’s EAT! it read in big, round letters. Ron leaned 
to the side, about to peek between the machines. “Hold on, 
she hissed, putting a hand on his shoulder. He drew back as 
if something had burned him. 

“It'll be okay,” Marla said, and Jessica marveled briefly 
that she sounded like she believed what she was saying. 
Behind them, something crashed against the door again, 
rattling the doorframe. Jessica waited, her eyes on the 
makeshift barricade, but nothing came. 

“We have to move slowly and quietly,” she whispered, 
and the three children nodded in unison. “Stay back,” 


” 


Jessica told them, and stepped out past the popcorn 
machine, alert to danger. She took a second to get her 
bearings: The walls of the dining room were lined with 
arcade games and children’s play areas, and on the far side 
of the room, blissfully, were the wide glass doors of the 
entrance. She motioned the others forward; the children, 
huddled together, followed her into the open room with 
Marla close behind. 

“Hurry,” she urged, and Marla nodded, taking Lisa’s hand 
as Alanna and Ron followed behind her, their faces pinched 
with exhaustion. Suddenly, Alanna screamed, and Jessica 
jumped. “What? What is it?” The girl was pointing ata 
jungle gym a few feet away, where two toddlers, too small 
to climb the bars, were nonetheless doing so. 

“It’s okay, they’re just toys,” Marla said, looking back at 
Jessica with a frazzled expression. “We saw them on the way 
in.” 

Alanna screamed again, and ran to Jessica, grabbing on 
to her waist. “It bit me!” 

“What?” Jessica looked down: Alanna’s ankle was 
bleeding, though not badly, and a few feet away was 
another crawling, robotic child. 

“Jessica!” Marla screamed, touching the device in her ear 
nervously. “It can’t see us, but it can see them.” As she 
spoke, the two other robotic children on the monkey bars 
lowered themselves unsteadily to the ground and began to 
crawl straight toward Lisa and Ron; they backed away, and 
a fourth appeared, boxing them in. Marla scooped up Lisa 
and Alanna and tried to hold them away from harm. 
“Jessica!” Marla screamed. “Help!” 

“It bit me,” Alanna repeated, panic in her voice, and the 
children clung together as the crawlers came closer, a slow 


march of determined toddlers with the black eyes of insects. 
“They can’t see us,” Jessica said with determination, darting 
forward and grabbing the nearest robot baby. It was heavier 
than it looked. Jessica held it out from her body. It was 
facing away from her, and she held on tight as it continued 
its crawling movements in the air, steadily putting its hands 
and feet into position, one after the other. She glanced 
around, then spotted the ball pit: at least four or five feet 
deep. Jessica threw the crawler down into the colorful balls 
as hard as she could, and it landed, half-buried, on its side, 
still repeating its motions, and slowly sank out of sight. 

“Marla, come on!” she shouted. Marla set down Lisa and 
Alanna beside Ron, then turned her attention to the baby 
crawling toward them. Her hands were shaking, like she was 
preparing to pick up a giant cockroach. “Marla!” Jessica 
shrieked. Marla screamed and shook her hands in the air, 
and the baby suddenly charged forward, clawing at the 
ground and biting at the children’s feet. Lisa cried and fell to 
the ground, and the heavy creature grabbed at her legs as it 
crawled up on top of her. Marla bolted forward with a blood- 
curdling scream and yanked the metal crawler off the little 
girl. Marla cried out again as she spun and threw the 
creature through the air. It missed Jessica’s head by an inch, 
Slammed into the net canopy above the ball pit, and 
dropped down into it, sinking out of sight. 

“You almost hit me!” Jessica had barely spoken the words 
when the third and final robot baby flew through the air and 
landed at her feet with a resounding bang. Marla let herself 
fall to the ground, breathing heavily, her eyes wide with 
panicked fury. Jessica stared down at the creature as it 
locked its sights on the children again. “Oh, no you don’t.” 
Jessica picked it up just as it started to crawl. She held it 


over the pit and it turned its head around completely to face 
her with its ant-like eyes. Its little rosebud mouth opened, 
flashing two rows of pointy predator’s teeth, then snapped 
shut, chomping the air. Jessica shuddered and dropped it, 
watching with grim fascination as it churned its arms and 
legs, digging itself deeper into the pit. 

“Jessica!” Marla cried, and she spun around. Lights had 
come on behind them, illuminating a large show stage with 
a bright purple curtain as its backdrop. On the stage, and in 
the spotlight, was a glossy and white Foxy animatronic, its 
mouth open and arms wide, ready to perform for a cheering 
crowd. The Fox looked down at them with delight. 

“Was that there a second ago?” Jessica whispered. 
Suddenly, the fox’s body began cracking apart: metal 
plates split away from the center of its torso, from its arms 
and legs, lifting out, splitting again and folding back, leaving 

only its canine head untouched, grinning maniacally as its 
body was horribly transformed. Jessica ran to the children as 
all at once, tentacle-like metal limbs erupted from what had 
been Foxy, and the mutilated skeleton creature stretched 
out into its new, semi-arachnid form. 

“Get them out!” Jessica cried. Alanna and Ron were 
frozen to the spot, staring, and Marla slapped their cheeks 
lightly. Ron snatched up Lisa’s hand, and together they all 
ran for the front door. 

“Jessica!” Marla cried as they reached the door. “We 
can’t let it get out!” The creature was on top of the monkey 
bars now, elongating itself to terrifying proportions as if 
showing off its tangled metal spines. 

“Get them out!” Jessica shouted again, pushing away 
from them, then turning her attention back to the mangled 
pink-and-white fox. The thing began to slowly dismount the 


monkey bars, its limbs slipping over and around one 
another, changing its shape with every step it took. Its 
foxlike face, and its vaguely human one, were both intent on 
the children, the heads angled slightly toward each other so 
that each of its eyes could focus. Jessica took a deep breath, 
then pulled the earpiece out of her ear, struggling to steady 
her hands long enough to slip it into her pocket. “Over 
here!” she screamed as loudly as she could, her throat 
going raw, and the canine head ducked under the other 
neck, its eye rolling around to fix on her. “Yeah, over here!” 
Jessica cried, her voice hoarse, and the thing came down 
from the monkey bars with menacing grace and began to 
slink toward her. She glanced around. Should have thought 
this through. At the door, she could see Marla bracing it 
open and shooing the children through, one at a time, then 
looking back to Jessica. 

Jessica nodded her head and waved Marla away. She 
grabbed a folding chair from a nearby table and hefted it 
over her head, then flung it at the creature. It landed with a 
clatter on the floor, missing the thing entirely. The fox head 
cocked to the side, its mouth hanging open to show all of its 
teeth, then it lurched forward, its metal appendages 
banging against the ground. Jessica turned and ran. 

She looked around wildly for an escape as she darted 
through the mass of tables at the center of the room; she 
shoved over a table behind her, but the thing just climbed 
over it like it was flat ground. Jessica sped up. The creature 
was right behind her, the fox head snapping its jaws as the 
unskinned skull grinned ghoulishly from its swing. She raced 
back the way they had come, ducking between the cotton 
candy machine and the popcorn cart. The sign blocking the 


doors was still in place, and she flung it away and yanked 
the door handle. It rattled in place, but still wouldn’t open. 

Something crashed behind her, and Jessica spun around 
to see the popcorn cart knocked over, popcorn strewn 
across the black-and-white floor tiles. The creature stretched 
out a limb and pushed the cotton candy machine 
experimentally; it rocked but did not fall, then another limb 
shot out. It hit Jessica’s leg with a smack, and she stumbled 
back against the door, an involuntary shout of pain blurting 
from her mouth. The fox and the unskinned head looked at 
each other, the head bouncing on its cables, then in unison 
they turned their eyes on her as the creature undulated its 
limbs, displaying their full extension. Jessica felt in her 
pocket for the earpiece, but couldn’t find it. It must have 
fallen out while she was running: she darted her eyes from 
side to side, afraid to move even her head. She was 
cornered, caught between the wall and a children’s climbing 
set: there was no way past the thing. 

All at once the creature seized the cotton candy machine 
with three of its limbs, crushing it; shattering glass sprayed 
in all directions as it carelessly flung the machine aside. 
Jessica shielded her face, turning away, and as the machine 
cracked the floor tiles behind her, she saw it: the red-and- 
yellow bars of the playset nearby led high above the room 
below, where a colorful pipe maze began, bolted tight to the 
ceiling, and disappearing into a circular hole in the wall and 
into the next room. That’s my way out. 

Jessica set her foot on the bottom rung of the playset and 
started to climb as fast as she could. Below her came a 
wrenching noise, and she glanced down to see the creature 
tearing up the playset, the unskinned head swinging and 
bobbing gleefully. It reached up and tore out the rung below 


her, and she climbed faster, hurling her upper body into the 
tube just as one of the creature’s hands grasped the last 
piece of the playset. Jessica scrabbled for a handhold, at last 
managing to pull her full body inside the tube. She crawled 
as fast as she could, the pipe shaking with every movement, 
then stopped to look down. Although some of the plastic 
tunnel was bolted to the ceiling, there were large portions 
that were not. This was made for kids, not me. Jessica 
rocked herself carefully, and the section of plastic below her 
rocked as well, the plastic segments creaking at the seams. 
Jessica shivered. Slow and steady. She checked her hands 
and knees, making sure they were safely in place, then 
started forward again. 

She was in a narrow, unadorned tube, hovering above an 
empty hallway, lit by a single, exposed florescent light that 
hummed as it flickered. The hum of the florescent light 
seemed to grow louder as she made her way cautiously 
along the fragile plastic flooring, filling her ears almost 
painfully, as if she had gone deep underground. She worked 
her jaw open and shut, trying to clear the sensation, but the 
noise persisted. When she reached the segment of tubing 
that went into the wall above the door, she hesitated, trying 
to see inside, but there was only darkness. Jessica took a 
deep breath, and carefully crossed into the next room. 

Silence fell: the humming noise was blissfully gone. The 
only light was behind her, and bizarrely it did not penetrate 
into the room, as if it were somehow being filtered out. She 
looked back and saw the circle of light where she had come, 
but everything else was in darkness. Jessica blinked, waiting 
for her eyes to adjust, but all she saw was black. Okay, then. 
She shuffled slowly forward, feeling carefully and sliding her 
knees along the support beams that ran along sections of 


the tunnel. After a few minutes, she came to a turn, 
bumping her head gently on the plastic, and she felt her 
way around it with a vague sense of accomplishment. 

A point of orange light appeared below her, and she 
Startled, her hand slipping off the support beam and rattling 
the plastic. She caught her balance, her heart racing, and a 
pair of green lights appeared, a few feet away from the first 
one. They vanished, then reappeared, and another pair, 
purple, sprang out of the darkness beside them, and this 
time Jessica saw the dark pinpoint at the center of each 
circle. Jessica tensed with an awful recognition, as more and 
more sets of colored lights appeared: Eyes. They’re eyes. 
The room below was slowly filling with sets of eyes, until it 
seemed impossible that so many creatures could fit into the 
Space; they all stared upward, unblinking at Jessica. She 
moved slowly forward, her hands shaking as they found 
their way along the beams, and the eyes followed her as 
she went. Don’t look down. 

Jessica set her gaze on the darkness in front of her and 
shuffled on and on for what felt like ages; each time she 
glanced down there were more pairs and pairs of watchful 
eyes, all of them rapt on her progress. Jessica shivered. She 
moved faster, still feeling carefully before she slid her hands 
and knees along, then the tube curved slightly, and a circle 
of dim light came into view. Jessica crawled for it as fast as 
she dared, the tube swaying precariously as she moved. She 
crawled through the hole and turned back: the room was in 
darkness again; all the eyes had vanished. 

Jessica shuddered, revolted, then looked down at the 
room she now hovered above. The light was dim and 
unsteady, flashing strange colors at intervals, but she could 
see clearly. Peering down, Jessica saw that it was coming 


from the carnival games that filled the room, some flickering 
noiselessly and others giving steady light in every hue. She 
took a deep breath and looked ahead, trying to see where 
the tube led. / rea//y hope there’s another way out, she 
thought, and started crawling again. The plastic tubing 
rattled as she went, the only noise in the dark room. Jessica 
swallowed; as the adrenaline waned, she was beginning to 
remember how much she hated enclosed spaces. Just keep 
moving. She reached a split in the tubing: one way snaked 
around the perimeter of the room, the other through 
another wall, into the pipe maze bolted to the ceiling of the 
next room. She scanned the room, then made her choice. 
She took the turn, taking the tunnel that fed through the 
neatly cut hole in the wall, and found herself back in the 
main dining room. 

She paused and listened. There was no sound of 
movement in the dining room, and she craned her neck to 
look down through one of the large plastic panes, searching 
the area: the creature was nowhere to be seen. She had not 
noticed the play pipes that covered the ceiling before 
climbing up into them, but now she saw the extent of them, 
with no end in sight, and no way down. The playset she had 
climbed to enter the tunnels was utterly destroyed. How am 
| going to get out? She cast her eyes helplessly over the 
maze, tracing the paths she could take, and suddenly she 
Saw it: the ball pit where she had thrown the baby crawlers 
was across the room, and it had a canopy made of climbing 
rope that stretched fifteen or twenty feet above the floor. 
The tube went directly over it. Jessica took a deep breath 
and crawled farther out into the room, bracing herself. She 
made it to the first turning point, and suddenly the pipe 
shook. She paused, but the structure shook again, and 


again. The light was being obscured from below her, and 
Jessica looked down. 

The unskinned skull grinned up at her with yellow eyes, 
suspended below as if out of nowhere. The head swiveled 
sideways and elevated up and over the plastic tunnel. 
Jessica looked up in dread, and saw the body of the creature 
right above her, its limbs wrapped around the tube like a 
monstrous squid seizing a ship. She stifled a scream, and 
her heart skipped as she fought not to hyperventilate. The 
fox head lowered to eye level and snapped beside her, and 
she screamed and shied away; her hand hit the plastic floor 
between the support beams and the segment fell straight 
down. Jessica clamored back before falling with it, and 
quickly took a corner, heading off to a new direction. The fox 
head swooped upward in a blur and vanished. 

Jessica crawled in a straight line, keeping her eyes fixed 
ahead. The structure continued to shake, and she could 
hear plastic breaking behind her, as well as large segments 
of the pipe maze crashing to the ground. Soon she reached 
the ball pit, and she stared down at the canopy of ropes 
through the bottom of the tube, hesitating. Now what? The 
structure shook again, but this time it was different. This 
time it trembled as though someone, or something, were in 
the maze with her. The entirety of the structure swayed and 
rocked on the bolts it hung from. Jessica kicked out the 
plastic below her, bracing herself on the sides of the tube as 
she looked down. Something moved in the pit below: three 
of the crawlers’ heads were above the surface, staring up at 
her disembodied with blank eyes. In unison, they snapped 
their little jaws, and she startled, hitting her head on the top 
of the plastic tube. “Stupid babies,” she muttered. When 
she looked down again, they were back in motion, 


Swimming through the balls and snapping, apparently at 
random. Jessica shivered and froze, suddenly paralyzed at 
the next step of her plan. For a moment, she prayed that it 
wasn’t too late to just stay silent, and wait for danger to 
pass. 

The structure trembled again, this time over and over in 
rapid succession. A Spiral of shimmering metal flew through 
the tunnel, then she saw its gleaming fox’s head, its mouth 
open in an impossible smile. Jessica screamed and fell 
sideways through the hole, landing heavily on the rope 
canopy. It sank inward, giving her a split second before she 
began to slip downward. 

She grabbed wildly at the net, the ropes burning her 
hands and entangling her feet, then she got her footing, and 
scrambled back up the slope to the top, wrapping her hands 
around the metal support bar. She watched the hole in the 
bottom of the pipe that she had fallen through, expecting 
something to come out, but nothing did. There was motion 
in the pipes, barely visible through the thick foggy plastic. 
Jessica searched in panic, trying to locate the creature, but 
there was movement everywhere: every pipe seemed to be 
crawling with life. Then she realized, all of the movement 
was flowing in the same direction. Jessica followed the flow 
with her eyes, through pipe after pipe, all the way up toa 
plastic end cap just above her. With a crash, the end cap 
burst out of place, and bolts rained down from the sky, 
hitting Jessica on the head. The fox head beamed down at 
her. More of its body pushed its way through, more and 
more limbs emerging as it balanced itself delicately on the 
edge of the pipe like a cat preparing to pounce on a mouse. 

Something fell out of Jessica’s pocket with a ding. It was 
the earpiece, which must have been wedged into her other 


pocket. Jessica held steady, violently fumbling to retrieve 
the earpiece. The fox head craned sideways as the last 
piece of the monster exited the pipe and joined the rest of 
the metal mass, perched like a vulture on the rickety 
infrastructure of the pipes. 

Finally, the fox lunged. 

Jessica crammed the earpiece into her ear and jumped, 
and the creature slammed into the netting where she had 
been, its limbs shooting through the spaces in the net. 
Jessica landed on her back on the top of an arcade cabinet, 
then fell to the floor below with a thud, the wind knocked 
out of her, and she wheezed. The creature struggled to free 
itself from the net. The limbs writhed, then the whole body 
sank down with the net, tearing it off the frame as it went. 
The creature was stuck, its limbs tangled in the mesh. It 
thrashed and flailed, and its long, snakelike appendages 
lashed through the air. The net rocked back and forth, 
straining in its bonds, then gave way in an instant. The thing 
dropped straight down into the pit, sending colorful plastic 
balls splashing over the sides of the pit. It twisted 
frantically, still tangled in the torn netting, then suddenly it 
began to twitch. Jessica watched, wide-eyed, as the bound 
creature slowly sank into the ball pit with a sound like metal 
grinding metal; after a moment it vanished entirely, though 
the balls boiled up frenziedly as the gnashing sound 
continued. Briefly, she caught a glimpse of a black-eyed 
crawler, chewing contentedly. She drew in a shaky breath, 
then ran for the front entrance. Jessica burst out through the 
double door and into the cool night air, and swayed on her 
feet. 

“Are you all right?” Marla asked with alarm. 


“I’m fine.” Jessica looked at each of the children, 
confirming that they were all there, all safe. Except one. 
Carlton, do you have him? She forced herself to smile. “So, 
who wants to visit a police station?” 


* OK OX 


Carlton crept quickly down the hall, scanning the walls and 
floor for signs of struggle—of anything that would indicate 
something had passed through. There was another door a 
little way down the hall, and he paused outside it, carefully 
turning the knob while staying outside the frame. Bracing 
himself, he pushed the door in, and waited. Nothing came 
out and he cautiously peered inside: the room was 
completely empty. “Calm before the storm?” he whispered 
to himself, and shut the door. 

When he reached the T in the hall he paused. Where are 
you, kid? He closed his eyes, listening. There was nothing, 
and then, a muffled scraping came from the wall behind 
him, back the way he and Marla had come. Carlton went 
toward it, and put his ear to the wall. The rustling continued. 
It was an odd sound he could not quite pinpoint, but it 
sounded like someone moving. He stepped back, examining 
the wall: It was plain, painted beige, with a large, silver air 
vent near the baseboard, about three feet high and almost 
as wide. That’s strange ... Carlton knelt down in front of the 
vent and turned on his flashlight—which worked, somewhat 
impressively, after its extended use as a blunt instrument. 
He turned the beam on the vent, and squinted, trying to see 
inside, but the slats were too close together to make out 
anything. 


A faint sound came from somewhere deep inside; it was 
indistinct, but it was unmistakably a voice. Carlton tugged 
at the grate with his fingernails, and it moved easily; he 
pulled the whole thing out, revealing a dark tunnel about 
four feet high. He shone his flashlight inside: The walls were 
concrete, painted red on one side and blue on the other in 
faded colors. Incomprehensible words were scribbled on 
them in crayon, and the yellow linoleum floor was scuffed 
with black sneaker marks, scratched, and turning up at the 
edges. “This place /s brand-new, right?” Carlton muttered as 
he crouched down and crawled inside, keeping the light 
ahead of him. It was unsettling to think of someone carefully 
laying down a new floor, then marking it with deliberate 
signs of wear; adult hands mimicking children’s painstaking 
handwriting and simple drawings. He cast the light around: 
on the red wall there was a drawing of a house and stick 
figures; underneath someone had written My House with the 
e drawn backward. The sound of the voice came again, 
echoing faintly through the tunnel ahead, and Carlton 
crawled forward awkwardly with the flashlight in one hand. 

The wall color changed every few feet, cycling through 
the rainbow at random, with childlike graffiti soaced 
unevenly all along the way. He came to what he thought 
was an opening to a new tunnel, but when he turned the 
light toward it, he saw that it was only a cubbyhole, small 
enough for a child to squeeze into. In the corner of it was a 
little blue sneaker, the laces untied, and Carlton swallowed. 
What is this place? 

His flashlight lit on a silently screaming face, and Carlton 
jumped back, dropping the light. He snatched it up again, 
his heart thumping, and shone it on the figure: it was a jack- 
in-the-box stuck in its “surprise” position: a white-faced 


clown, its mouth gaping in perpetual laughter. “This isn’t a 
vent,” Carlton whispered, letting the light leave the painted 
face and continue down the colorful hall littered with hiding 
Spaces and scuff marks. “This is part of the play area.” 

The light fixed on a rainbow stretching above one of the 
hiding Spaces. HIDE-AND-SEEK HALLWAY, it read. “This can’t be 
good.” Carlton winced. The child’s voice echoed again, this 
time a little louder, and he shook off the eerie sensation. /’m 
coming, kid, he promised silently. 

He rounded a corner, but stopped short: there was an 
animatronic baby in a cubbyhole, motionless, laying on its 
back. Carlton’s elbows and knees trembled. Please don’t 
move. 

Black, insect-like eyes stared blankly at him from a 
sweet, plastic face; the crawler did not move, apparently 
deactivated. He backed away cautiously, and turned his 
light on the path ahead; he was approaching a turn, but 
there was still no sign of an exit. He crawled on, passing 
stick figures and houses that were beginning to look 
suspiciously repetitive. 

“| s-ee you...” 

Carlton whirled around. There was nothing in sight but a 
closed door. It was the size of the other cubbyholes, child- 
height, with a small, heart-shaped window near the top. As 
he passed his light over the little door, something glinted 
through the heart-shaped window. Carlton stiffened, but 
before he could think to move, the door broke off its hinges 
as Freddy crawled forcefully out, a maniacal grin on his 
shiny purple-and-white face as he unfolded from the 
cramped space he had stuffed himself into. Carlton crawled 
backward frantically, and Freddy matched his motions, 


keeping a distance of inches between them. Carlton glanced 
around, then turned and crawled as fast as he could down 
the tunnel, his knees and hands slamming into the floor 
painfully as he raced to get away. He glanced back: Freddy 
was crawling behind him, his mechanical arms and legs 
thundering faster than Carlton could hope to escape. He 
rounded a corner, and Freddy caught his foot, the iron 
fingers digging into his heel. Carlton kicked with his other 
foot, wresting himself free, and got to his feet and started to 
run, hunched down to half his height and scraping the 
ceiling with his back. From behind, he could hear the sound 
of Freddy bearing down on him, his hands and knees 
pounding the floor with vibrating force. 

Carlton turned another corner, and relief surged through 
him: there was a vent along the tunnel, an actua/ vent that 
led to a large room. Carlton kicked it out without hesitation 
and scurried through to the room on the other side. 

The room was enormous, seemingly designed to house a 
single, giant carnival ride: it was a ring of seats set on an 
angle, held together by huge metal arms on a Spiral, a 
terrifying variation on the merry-go-round that would whip 
around at high speed while tilting nauseatingly up and 
down. On the far side of it was a door marked exit. Before 
Carlton could run for the door, Freddy burst out of the 
tunnel, climbing to his feet, his eyes sickeningly reflective in 
the dark. 

“| see you so Clearly now,” said the speaker in Freddy’s 
chest. 

Carlton turned to run, then smacked into the carnival 
ride, biting his lip and drawing blood. 


He turned back just in time to see Freddy lunge at him, 
and Carlton ducked under the ride, the blow just missing 
him and hitting the metal side of the tilted merry-go-round. 
The sound rang out in the vast, empty room, and he 
shuddered, then leaped back as another blow hit the ride 
above him, reverberating so hard it rattled his teeth. Carlton 
looked up: the metal had bowed out above his head, caving 
to Freddy’s strength. 

“You can’t escape ...” 

Carlton scrambled away, tripping over the heavy steel 
beams that undergirded the ride, bolting it to the ground. 
Freddy’s shiny purple-and-white calves stalked him calmly, 
keeping pace with him along the perimeter of the ride as 
Carlton ducked under heavy cables and mysterious, 
frightening-looking gears. 

“I’ve alm-ost got you ...” Freddy announced. 

“Not yet,” Carlton muttered as he carefully untangled his 
foot from the heavy wire that had ensnared him. He craned 
his neck, trying to see the room around him: There was no 
way he could get past Freddy, and even if he did, he would 
pursue him relentlessly. Carlton was backed up against the 
tilted end of the ride, and up against the control platform. 
As he craned his head upward he could see a large on/off 
lever, which was almost in reach. 

“Nowhere else to run...” 

Carlton waited for Freddy to make his way deeper under 
the ride, pressing and contorting his body to get at Carlton 
between the beams. Carlton squeezed out from under the 
ride and hoisted himself just high enough to pull the lever 
and activate the ride, then dropped to the ground and 
covered his head. Freddy reached for him, but the ride tilted 
abruptly. 


Carlton saw Freddy jerk about, wrenched by the moving 
parts, until the ride jolted hard. Carlton clutched his head as 
his ears rang with the impact, a growing shriek of tearing 
metal and grating gears as the ride slowed, wobbling 
unsteadily on its axis. Carlton didn’t move: from where he 
had landed he could see the apparatus in motion, shredding 
through the body of what had been Freddy as the machine 
ground on inexorably through its routine. Scraps of purple 
appeared and vanished, then fell to the floor, spat out by 
the machine. A yellow eyeball appeared in a space above 
two gears, and Carlton watched with shocked fascination as 
the rest of the precariously balanced body was pulverized 
by the alternating beams, then dropped to the ground in 
several distinct masses. 

The machine screeched ear-splittingly, then slowed and 
sputtered to a dead stop. Carlton didn’t move for a moment. 
He got to his feet and cautiously moved away from the 
apparatus, carefully avoiding the littered scraps of metal 
and plastic on the ground. He didn’t dare climb under the 
thing again, but he prodded it gently with his toe, then 
yanked his foot back as something dropped out. 

Half of Freddy’s head, one-eyed and still grinning 
insanely, fell out of the machine near Carlton, spun partially 
on the ground, then stopped moving, and its single eye 
flickered on, then sputtered and died. The speaker in the 
now-smashed chest piece, laying armless and legless 
nearby, crackled with static, then spoke, “Thanks for 
playing; come again soon!” The voice trailed away and went 
silent. 

In the distance, the child’s scream came again, and 
Carlton was startled back to himself. 


“Hang on, kid,” he whispered, and headed grimly for the 
door. 





Charlie’s duplicate stared back at her, looking stunned for 
an instant, then Charlie watched her own face curve into a 
bright, cruel smile. The other Charlie didn’t move, and 
Charlie’s fear receded as she watched this strange imitation 
of herself, astonished. That’s my face. Charlie reached up 
and touched her own cheek, and the other girl imitated her; 
Charlie tilted her head to the side, and the girl mirrored her 
movement—Charlie could not tell if she was being mocked, 
or if the other girl was simply as entranced as she was. The 
duplicate was a little taller than Charlie, and Charlie flicked 
her eyes to the girl’s feet: her black combat boots had 
heels. She was wearing a red V-neck shirt and a short black 
Skirt, and her hair was long and hung in shiny waves—a look 
Charlie had given up even attempting halfway through ninth 
grade. She looked polished; confident in her stance. She 


looked the way Charlie wished she could be: some version 
of herself that had figured out curling irons, and 
sophistication, and taking up space in the world without 
apology. 

“What are you?” Charlie whispered, mesmerized. 

“Come on,” the other Charlie said, holding out her hand, 
and Charlie started to reach out to her, then stopped 
herself, yanking her hand away. She shrank away, stumbling 
back across the hall and her duplicate closed the distance 
between them, leaning in so close Charlie should have felt 
her breathing. A long moment passed, but the other Charlie 
did not draw breath. “You need to come with me,” she said. 
“Father wants us to come home.” Charlie startled at the 
phrase. 

“My father is dead,” she said. She pressed back against 
the wall, as far from the girl’s face as she could get. 

“Well, would you like to have a live one?” the other 
Charlie asked, with a mocking edge. 

“There is nothing that you can give me, and certainly not 
that,” Charlie said shakily, inching backward into the 
storage room; the duplicate followed her step for step. 
Charlie glanced past the duplicate and into the open 
bedroom door; John emerged into the hallway, leaning 
heavily on the doorframe and gripping his side. 

“Are you Okay, Charlie?” he asked in a low, steady voice. 

“Oh, I’m just fine, John!” Charlie’s duplicate said 
cheerfully. 

“Charlie?” John repeated, ignoring her. Charlie nodded, 
not daring to take her eyes off the imposter. 

“She says Father wants us to come home,” Charlie said. 

John stepped up behind the other Charlie. 


“Father? Would that be William Afton?” John demanded. 
He took a few sprinted steps and grabbed a lamp by its 
base, raising it for attack. The other Charlie smiled again, 
then swiftly raised her arm and backhanded John across the 
face. He dropped the lamp and staggered backward, 
catching himself against the wall, and the duplicate grabbed 
for Charlie’s hand. Charlie ducked away, running for the 
hallway with the girl on her heels. 

“Hey! That was just round one!” John shouted, beckoning 
his assailant to come back. He grabbed the duplicate girl’s 
arm, yanking her back toward him and away from where 
Charlie had run. The duplicate allowed John to hold her 
close, not resisting. John was washed with fear as he stood 
eye-to-eye with the imposter. Now what do | do? 

“Just like by the old oak tree when we were little, John,” 
the duplicate whispered. She pulled him close and pressed 
her lips against his. His eyes widened, and he tried to push 
her away, but he could not move. When she finally released 
him and pulled back, she was Charlie, his Charlie, and there 
was a high, painful ringing in his ears. He covered his ears, 
but the ringing increased exponentially, and for the few 
brief seconds before he collapsed to the ground, he saw her 
face morph into a thousand things. The room spun, and his 
head hit the ground with a crack. 


* OK OX 


The girl smiled and glanced at Charlie, then drew back her 
foot and kicked John in the ribs, knocking him onto his side 
and against a heavy wooden trunk. Charlie ran toward him, 
but before she could reach him, the girl grabbed her hair, 
bringing tears to her eyes. The imposter pulled upward, 


lifting Charlie several inches off the ground, and then flung 
her aside. Charlie tried to regain her footing but tripped 
backward over a cardboard box and slammed hard into the 
opposite wall, knocking the wind out of her as John got 
warily to his feet. Charlie climbed to her knees. She dragged 
in heavy, grinding breaths, watching helplessly as the other 
Charlie strode toward John. 

He straightened, and without a pause, she punched him 
in the stomach. He doubled over, and before he could stand, 
She hit the back of his head with her fist, like it was a 
hammer and he was a nail. 

John fell forward, catching himself on his hands and 
knees, and scrambled up. He lunged again at the girl, 
catching her shoulder with his fist, but the blow glanced off 
her, and he yelped in pain, clutching his hand like it had hit 
something harder than flesh and bone. The imposter took 
him by the shoulders, lifting him off the ground, and carried 
him across the room, then pressed him against the wall. She 
released him and let him stand, turning to look at Charlie 
momentarily, then she placed her open palm against John’s 
chest. 

Suddenly, John began to gasp for breath, his face turning 
red. The imposter’s face remained unchanged, her open 
hand slowly pressing harder against his chest. “I can’t—” 
John gasped for air. “Can’t breathe.” He clutched at her arm 
with both hands, but it was no use as she continued to 
steadily press into him. John slowly began to slide up the 
wall, inch by inch, the pressure forcing his entire body 
upward. 

“Stop!” Charlie cried, but the other Charlie didn’t flinch. 
“Please!” Charlie scrambled to her feet and ran to John’s 
side, but the other Charlie snapped out her other arm and 


caught her by the neck without moving her hand from 
John’s chest. Her fingers closed on Charlie’s throat, closing 
off her windpipe as she lifted her up onto her toes. Charlie 
choked, kicking and gasping. The imposter held her there, 
looking expressionlessly from Charlie to John as she kept 
them both immobilized and struggling to breathe. 

“Okay,” Charlie wheezed. “I want to talk. Please,” she 
begged hoarsely. The imposter dropped them both. John fell 
motionless to the floor. “You’ve hurt him, let me help him.” 
Charlie coughed, pulling herself up. 

“You're so attached to something so ... easily broken,” 
she said with amusement. Charlie strained to see past her, 
anxiously watching John’s chest as it rose and fell. He’s 
alive. Charlie took a breath, then turned to face the girl who 
had her face. 

“What do you want to talk about?” she asked tightly. 


* OK OX 


Carlton let the heavy door slam shut behind him and ran on 
without looking back: there was another door up ahead, and 
dim light filtered through a small window near the top. The 
child’s cry echoed again, and Carlton froze, unable to 
pinpoint its direction. The high-pitched sound pierced the air 
again, and he grimaced at the sound: it was raw and thin, 
the scream of a kid who had been screaming for a long 
time. Carlton peered through the window in the door—it 
looked deserted, and he opened the door cautiously, then 
stopped dead. Everything looked the same: every hall, 
every room. Lights flickered, soeakers hummed. One light 
seemed to be about to burn out, making a high-pitched 
screech that echoed through the chamber. 


“Kid,” he whispered, but there was no answer, and 
Carlton was suddenly aware that he may have been chasing 
echoes and lights for the last ten minutes. He suddenly felt 
the weight of how alone he was, and it became a physical 
thing; the air itself seemed to grow heavier around him. His 
breath slowed, and he dropped to his knees, then fell back 
to sit. He stared down the empty hallway despairingly, and 
finally scooted to the side, maneuvering his back against 
the wall so he could at least see his assailant before he died 
—whoever—or whatever—his assailant might turn out to be. 

I’ve failed. I’m not going to find him. Tears sprang to his 
eyes unexpectedly. Michael, I’m so sorry. In the days after 
Michael disappeared, his father had asked him so many 
questions, going over that one afternoon like he believed 
together they could re-create it and solve the puzzle. / 
searched for the missing piece, | promise, | searched. He 
had gone over every moment of the little party in his mind, 
desperately trying to find the clue his father needed, the 
detail that would make everything clear. 

There were so many things he could have done to stop 
what had happened, if he had known then what he knew 
now. 

But now | know it all, and there’s still nothing | can do. 

“| failed you, Michael.” Carlton put his hand on his chest, 
trying to calm himself and not hyperventilate. / failed you, 
again. 


* OK OX 


“So, what do you want to talk about?” Charlie repeated. The 
other Charlie narrowed her eyes. 


“That’s better, a lot better.” The girl smiled, and Charlie 
leaned back as far away from her as she could. It was 
unnerving to see her own face glaring back at her, 
accusatory and petulant. 

“I'll listen to anything you want to say, just don’t hurt 
him more,” Charlie pleaded, her hands raised in surrender, 
her heart fluttering. Charlie’s duplicate flushed with anger. 

“This is why,” she hissed, shaking her finger accusingly. 

“What? This is why? | don’t understand,” Charlie cried. 

Charlie’s imposter paced the floor, her anger seeming to 
have drained as quickly as it came. Charlie took the 
opportunity to look to John again, who had rolled partially 
onto his back, holding his side as though in immense pain, 
his face still red. He needs help. 

“What are you?” Charlie growled, her anger rising at the 
sight of John. 

“The question isn’t what am I. It’s what are you? And 
what makes you so special, over and over again?” Charlie’s 
duplicate approached her with renewed anger, grabbing 
Charlie by the throat once more and lifting her off the 
ground. She pinned her to the wall, baring all her teeth. 

The ruse of Charlie’s imposter faded, revealing a painted 
clown face, somehow looking angrier than the human 
facade. The white plates of the face opened like a flower, 
revealing yet another face, made of coils and wires, with 
bare black eyes and jagged prongs for teeth. Her real face, 
Charlie thought. 

“ASk again,” she growled. 

“What?” Charlie choked. 

“| said ask me again,” the metal monster snarled. 

“What are you?” Charlie whimpered. 


“Il told you, that’s not the right question.” The metal girl 
held Charlie out at a distance and looked her up and down. 
“Where did he hide it?” She held Charlie’s throat with one 
hand and put her other hand on Charlie’s chest, then ran a 
finger down the length of her breastbone. Then her eyes 
shot to Charlie’s face, and she grabbed her chin and turned 
her head forcefully to the side. She seemed lost in thought 
for only a moment then snapped back. “Ask again.” 

Charlie locked eyes with the metal face. The face plates 
closed over the tangle of twisted metal, reassembling the 
face of the clown, with her rosy cheeks and glossy lips. Soon 
the illusion returned, and Charlie was staring into her own 
eyes again. Charlie felt herself growing uncannily calm as 
she began to realize what the right question was. 

“What am |?” 

The imposter loosened her grip, and lowered Charlie so 
that her feet touched the ground. “You are nothing, Charlie,” 
the imposter said. “You look at me and you see a soulless 
monster; how ironic. How twisted. How backward.” She let 
go of Charlie’s throat and took a step back, her red lips 
losing their savor for the moment. “How unfair.” 

Charlie was on her knees again, struggling to regain her 
strength. The imposter approached her and knelt with her, 
placing her hand over Charlie’s. “I’m not sure how this will 
work, but let’s give it a try,” she whispered, running her 
fingers through Charlie’s hair and firmly grasping the back 
of her neck. 

She was a little girl, holding a piece of paper in her hand, 
excited and full of joy. A bright gold foil star shimmered on 
the page, above the glowing words of her kindergarten 
teacher. Someone gently touched her back, encouraging her 


to run forward into the room, into the dark. She eagerly ran 
inside, and there he was, standing by the work desk. 

“How long did | stand there before he shooed me away?” 
Charlie searched her mind, but the answers didn’t come. 

“He didn’t shoo me away,” Charlie’s other voice 
answered. 

Her eagerness didn’t fade, she remained patient and 
Joyful. After the first push, she came back to try again. It 
was only after the second push that she hesitated to go 
back, but she carefully returned anyway, this time holding 
the paper into the air. Maybe he didn’t see it. 

“He saw it,” Charlie’s other voice spoke down to her. 

This time it hurt; the ground was cold, and her arm ached 
where she had fallen on it. She looked for the paper: it was 
on the floor in front of her, her gold star still shone bright, 
but he was standing on the page now. She looked up to see 
if he noticed, tears in her eyes. She knew she should leave 
it, but she couldn’t. She reached forward to tug at the 
corner, but it was too far away. She finally crawled to it on 
her knees, her dress dirty now, and tried to pull the page 
from under his shoe. It wouldn’t come loose. 

“That’s when he hit me.” 

It was difficult to make out anything in the room after 
that. The room was a smear of tears and pain and her head 
was still spinning. But she made out one thing, a shiny 
metal clown doll. Her father had turned his attention back to 
it, lovingly polishing her. Suddenly, her pain faded to the 
background, replaced with fascination, obsession. 

“What is all of this?” Charlie cried. 

Now she was looking at herself in the mirror, holding a 
stick of lipstick that she’d stolen from her teacher’s purse. 


But she wasn’t painting her lips with it, she was drawing 
bright red circles on her cheeks. The lips came next. 

“Are you listening to me?” the doppelganger whispered. 

Night had swept over everything. The rooms were dark, 
the halls were silent, the lab was still. Her feet made soft 
pats against the smooth white tiles. A tiny camera in the 
corner had a red blinking light on it, but it didn’t matter 
what it saw, it was too late to stop her. 

She pulled the sheet away from the beautiful clown girl, 
beckoning her to speak. Where was the button, the one he 
always pressed? 

The eyes lit up first, and then other lights from within. It 
didn’t take long for the painted face to search the room and 
find her, greeting her with a sweet smile and soft voice. 

“Then there was screaming.” The illusion was broken, 
and Charlie pushed herself away. “Then there was 
screaming,” the imposter repeated. “It was coming from 
me, but ...” She paused and pointed to her own head with a 
look of curiosity. “But | remember seeing her scream.” She 
looked thoughtful for a second, and suddenly the illusion 
dissipated, and she appeared again as the painted clown. 
“It’s strange to remember the same moment from two pairs 
of eyes, but then we were one.” 

“| don’t believe that story,” Charlie growled. “I don’t 
believe that story at all. You aren’t possessed! If you think | 
will believe for one second that I’m talking to the spirit of a 
sweet and innocent little girl, then you’re crazy.” 

“| want you to call me Elizabeth,” the girl said softly. 

“Elizabeth?” Charlie answered. “If you were this little girl, 
Elizabeth, | can’t bring myself to believe that that little girl 
would be capable of all of this.” 


“The anger isn’t from her,” Elizabeth said, her painted 
face shifting: she looked like a wounded animal, vulnerable 
but still poised to attack. 

“Then what?” Charlie cried. 

“My anger is from a different father.” Elizabeth strode to 
Charlie again, grabbing her neck again and jostling her into 
a white light and pain, where suddenly all was calm. 

A hand was stroking her hair. The sun was going down 
over a field of grain. A cluster of birds were fluttering 
overhead, their calls echoing out over the landscape. “I’m 
so happy to be here with you,” a kind voice said. She looked 
up and nestled against him. 

“No, this is mine,” Charlie protested. 

“No,” Elizabeth intruded. “That doesn’t belong to you. 
Let me show you what does belong to you.” 

Agony erupted, flooding the room with its sound. The 
walls went black and streams of water poured down from 
behind the window curtains. A man lay curled on the floor, 
something cradled tightly in his arms, and when his mouth 
opened, the room shook with the sound of his anguish. 

“Who is that?” Charlie said anxiously. “What is he 
holding?” 

“You don’t recognize her?” Elizabeth said. “That’s Ella, of 
course. It’s all your father had left after you were taken.” 

“What, no, that’s not Ella.” Charlie shook her head. 

“He cried over that cheap store-bought rag doll for two 
months,” Elizabeth snarled with disbelief. “He cried into it, 
he bled into it, he poured his grief over it. Very unhealthy. 
He began to treat it as though he still had a daughter.” 

“That was my memory, me sitting with my dad, watching 
the sun go down. We were waiting for the stars to come out. 
That’s my memory,” Charlie said angrily. 


“Look again,” Elizabeth instructed, forcing the image 
upon her once more. 

There was a hand stroking her hair. The sun was going 
down over a field of grain. A cluster of birds were fluttering 
overhead, their calls echoing out over the landscape. “I’m 
so happy to be here with you,” a kind voice said. He gripped 
the doll tightly, and smiled despite the tears streaming from 
his face. 

“Of course, he wasn’t content with that, you had to grow 
up. So, he made more.” 

Her arms hung off the side of the workbench. The joints 
were stiff enough to carry something lightweight, and her 
eyes were more realistic than he had ever made them 
before. He propped her up and extended her arms straight 
in front of her, carefully balancing a small tray on them, 
then setting a teacup on the tray. He furrowed his brow with 
frustration for a moment, turning a brass knob over and 
over until the room quivered and flashed, then everything 
stood still, and the little girl looked at him and smiled. 

“That’s MY memory!” Charlie screamed. 

“No, that’s his memory,” Elizabeth corrected. 

“Jen, | swear she is more than another animatronic doll. 
You should see. She walks, and she talks.” 

“Of course she walks and talks, Henry.” Jen’s voice was 
angry. “She walks because everything you build can walk, 
and she talks because everything you build can talk. But the 
reason why this one seems so real is because you're 
destroying your mind with these frequencies and codes.” 
Jen threw her arms in the air. 

“She remembers, Jen. She remembers me. She 
remembers our family.” 


“No, Henry. You remember. Zap your head with enough of 
those rays and! bet you can get the teakettle to tell you 
about your lost family.” 

“My lost family,” Henry repeated. 

Jen took pause, looking regretful. “It doesn’t have to be 
that way, but you need to let go of this. Your wife; your son, 
they can still be a part of your life, but you have to let go of 
this.” 

“She is in this doll.” He gestured to Ella, who was 
standing upright with her teacup perched on the tray. A little 
rag doll sat in a wooden chair in the corner, its head draped 
over the armrest, its eyes staring out over the room. 

“It took him a while to figure out that it was the rag doll, 
the little store-bought rag doll. Maybe he never sensed you 
when it wasn’t around, | don’t know. But over time, he 
started putting it inside his Charlie, whatever new Charlie he 
built.” 

Charlie sat speechless, remembering all the times with 
her father, questioning each of them. S/tting on the floor of 
his workshop, building a block tower out of scraps of wood 
as he bent over his work. He turned back to her and smiled, 
and she smiled back, beloved. Her father went back to his 
work, and the jumbled creature in the far, dark corner 
twitched. Charlie startled, knocking her blocks to the 
ground, but her father did not seem to hear. She began to 
rebuild the tower, but the creature kept drawing her gaze: 
the twisted metal skeleton with its burning, silver eyes. It 
twitched again, and she wanted to ask, but could not make 
herself speak the words. 

“Does it hurt?” Charlie whispered, the image so clear 
that she could almost smell the hot, metallic scent of the 
workshop. Elizabeth froze, then all at once the illusion 


vanished and the metal plates of her clown-painted face 
Stripped back, baring the coils and wires, and jagged teeth. 
Charlie shrank back, and Elizabeth moved with her, 
maintaining the distance between them. 

“Yes,” she whispered, and her eyes blazed silver. “Yes. It 
hurt.” 

The plates of her face folded back in, but her eyes still 
glowed. Charlie blinked and looked away; the light blinded 
her, poking pinpoint holes in her vision. Elizabeth stared 
bitterly. “So, you remember me, then?” 

“Yes.” Charlie rubbed her eyes as her vision began to 
clear. “In the corner. | didn’t want to look. | thought it was ... 
| thought you were ... someone else,” she said, her voice 
sounding thin and childish to her own ears. 

Elizabeth laughed. “Did any of those other things really 
look like me? I’m unique. Look at me.” 

“It hurts my eyes,” Charlie said faintly, and Elizabeth 
grabbed her by the chin and pulled her close. Charlie shied 
away, closing her eyes against the light, and Elizabeth 
Slapped her cheek with painful force. 

“Look at me.” 

Charlie took a shaky breath and obeyed. Elizabeth’s face 
looked like Charlie’s again, but the silver light poured out 
coldly from the place where her eyes should be. Charlie let 
it flood her vision, blotting out everything else. 

“Do you know why my eyes were always glowing?” 
Elizabeth asked softly. “Do you know why | twitched and 
shuddered in the dark?” Charlie shook her head slightly, and 
Elizabeth let go of her chin. “It was because your father left 
me turned on all the time. Every moment, every day, | was 
aware, and unfinished. Watching him as the hours passed, 
and he created toys for the little Charlie, unicorns and 


bunnies that moved and talked as | hung in the dark, 
waiting. Abandoned.” The glare from her eyes faded a little, 
and Charlie blinked, trying not to show her relief. 

“Why am! even talking to you about this. You weren’t 
even there yet.” Elizabeth turned her face, almost in 
disgust. 

“| was,” Charlie answered. “I was there. | remember.” 
“You remember,” Elizabeth mocked. “Are you sure you 
were there for all of those memories?” Charlie searched her 
thoughts for anything that could confirm the memories she 

clung to. 

“Look down,” Elizabeth whispered. 

“What?” Charlie whimpered. 

“Your memory. I’m sure it’s crystal clear, since you were 
there and all.” Elizabeth smiled. “Look down.” 

Charlie returned to her memory, standing in front of her 
father’s workbench. She was immobile; she didn’t have a 
voice. “Look down,” Elizabeth whispered again. Charlie 
looked to her feet, but didn’t see feet at all, only three legs 
of a camera tripod anchored to the ground. 

“He was making memories for you; making a life for his 
little rag doll, making her a real girl. 

“I’m sure many of those memories have been elaborated 
upon, edited, and embellished, but make no mistake, 
Charlie wasn’t there.” Elizabeth leaned closer to Charlie. 

“He made us one, two, three.” Elizabeth touched 
Charlie’s shoulder lightly, then brought her hand back to her 
own chest. “Four.” Her eyes flickered, and the silver glow 
faded until her eyes looked nearly human. 

“Charlie would be a baby, then a little girl, and then a 
sulky teenager.” She looked Charlie up and down with a 
pointed sneer, then her expression cleared as she 


continued. “Then at last she would be a woman. She would 
be finished. Perfect. Me.” Elizabeth’s face tightened. “But 
something changed, as Henry labored, racked with grief, 
over his little girl. 

“The littlest Charlotte was made with a broken heart. She 
cried all the time, day and night. The second Charlotte he 
made when he was at the depth of madness, almost 
believing the lies he told himself; she was as hopelessly 
desperate for her father’s love as he was for hers. The third 
Charlotte he made when he began to realize he’d gone 
mad, when he questioned every thought he had, and 
begged his sister Jen to remind him what was real. The third 
Charlotte was strange.” Elizabeth gave Charlie a 
contemptuous look, but Charlie scarcely saw it. The third 
Charlotte was strange, she repeated silently. She ducked her 
head and rubbed the flannel of her father’s shirt with her 
thumb, then looked back up. Elizabeth’s face was stiff with 
rage; she was nearly trembling. 

“What about the fourth?” Charlie asked hesitantly. 

“There was no fourth,” she snapped. “When Henry began 
to make the fourth, his despair turned to rage. He seethed 
as he soldered her skeleton together, pouring his anger into 
the forge where he shaped her very bones. | was not 
Charlotte-drenched-in-grief. | was made alive with Henry’s 
fury.” Her eyes flared again with silver light, and Charlie 
stayed herself, forcing herself not to blink. Elizabeth leaned 
in closer, her face inches from Charlie’s. “Do you know the 
first words your father ever spoke to me?” she hissed. 
Charlie shook her head minutely. “He said to me, ‘You are 
wrong.’ 

“He tried to fix the flaw he saw in me, at first, but what 
was wrong, as Henry saw it, was the very thing that made 


me alive.” 

“Rage,” Charlie said softly. 

“Rage.” Elizabeth drew herself up and shook her head. 
“My father abandoned me.” Her face twitched. “Henry 
abandoned me,” she corrected herself. “Of course, | could 
not comprehend those memories until | had received a soul 
of my own—once | took it for myself.” She smiled. “Once | 
had endowed myself with a soul, | experienced those 
memories anew: not as an uncomprehending toy, twitching 
and seizing with an all-consuming rage | could not fathom, 
but as a person. As a daughter. It’s rather a cruel irony that | 
would escape the life of one neglected daughter only to 
embody another.” 

Charlie was silent, and for a moment her father’s face 
returned to her, his smile that was always so sad. Elizabeth 
laughed abruptly, shaking her out of her memories. 

“You're not Charlie, either, you Know. You’re not even the 
soul of Charlie,” Elizabeth mocked. “You aren’t even a 
person. You’re a ghost of a man’s regret, you’re what’s left 
of a man who lost everything, you’re the sad little tears that 
fell unceremoniously into a doll that used to belong to 
Charlie.” Elizabeth suddenly glared at her as if looking 
through her. “And if | had to take a guess ...” She grabbed 
Charlie under her chin and pulled her upright, studying her 
torso for a moment. She made a quick motion with her other 
hand and Charlie gasped; the room was spinning again. 
Elizabeth’s hand had disappeared, but it soon reemerged, 
and she was holding something. 

“Look before you lose consciousness,” Elizabeth 
whispered. There, before Charlie’s eyes, was a rag doll, and 
recognition flared. 

“Ella,” she tried to whisper. 


“This is you.” 
The room went dark.

What was that? Carlton lifted his head, holding his breath as 
he waited to hear it again. After a moment he did: someone 
was whimpering, and the sound was coming from nearby. 
Carlton took in a renewed gulp of air, instantly filled with 
new purpose. After hours of flickering bulbs and distant 
echoes, this was right beside him. Carlton leaped to his feet: 
across the hall a door was ajar, with an orange light glowing 
unsteadily from inside. How did / not notice that? Carlton 
made his way across the hall, sliding his feet along the floor 
SO as not to make a sound. When he reached the door, he 
peered in cautiously through the crack: The orange light 
was from an open furnace set into the wall, its mouth large 
enough to fit a small car. The furnace was the only light in 
the dark room, but he could make out a long table, with 
something dark lying on it. 

The whimpering came again, and this time Carlton’s eyes 
lit on its source: a small, blond-haired boy was huddled in 
the darkest corner of the room, opposite the furnace. 
Carlton ran into the room and knelt beside the boy, who 
looked up at him numbly. He was bleeding from shallow cuts 
on his arm and one corner of his mouth, but Carlton saw no 
other visible injuries. 

“Hey,” he whispered nervously. “Are you okay?” The boy 
didn’t respond, and Carlton took hold of his arms, readying 
to pick him up. When he touched the child, he could feel the 
tremors throughout his body. He’s terrified. “Come on, we're 


getting out of here,” Carlton said. The little boy pointed to 
the creature on the table. 

“Save him, too,” the boy whispered tearfully. “He hurts 
so bad.” He squeezed his eyes shut. Carlton glanced at the 
large, motionless figure on the table by the furnace: he 
hadn’t considered that it might be a person. He scanned the 
room to make sure nothing else was moving, then patted 
the boy on the shoulder and got to his feet. 

He approached the table cautiously, keeping to the wall 
instead of walking across the center of the room. As he got 
closer, the burning smell of metal and oil rushed up against 
him, and he covered his face with his sleeve, trying not to 
gag as he examined the prone figure. 

It’s not a person. On the table, illuminated by the 
flickering orange light, was a mass of metal: a melted, 
clumpy skeleton of metal bulges and blobs, barely 
resembling anything at all. Carlton studied the thing fora 
long moment, then looked back at the little boy, uncertain 
what to say. 

“Heat,” a voice snarled, and Carlton spun around to face 
a twisted man, creeping out from the shadows. “Heat is the 
key to all of this,” the man went on as he haltingly 
approached the table. “If you keep all this at just the right 
temperature, it’s malleable, it’s moldable, and it’s highly, 
highly effective; or maybe contagious is the word. | suspect 
you could put it in anything, but it’s best to put it into 
something that you can control—at least to a certain 
extent.” William Afton lurched into the light, and Carlton 
stepped back reflexively, though the table was between 
them. “It’s an interesting alchemy,” William continued. “You 
can make something that you control completely, but that 
has no will of its own, like a gun, | Suppose.” He ran his 


withered hand over the silver arm of the creature. “Or you 
can take a drop of ... pixie dust.” He smiled. “And you can 
create a monster that you ... mostly control, one with 
unlimited potential.” 

Carlton. He stepped back with a shout of surprise: the 
voice was so Clear in his head that he recognized it instantly. 
“Michael?” The single word was enough. Carlton turned to 
the table with a new, terrible clarity. He knew exactly what 
he was looking at: the endoskeletons of the original Freddy’s 
animatronics, welded and melted together, immobile and 
featureless. And still inhabited by the spirits of the children 
who had been murdered inside of them so many years ago. 
Still filled with life, and motion, and thought—all trapped; all 
in terrible pain. Carlton forced himself to look William Afton 
in the eye. 

“How could you do this to them?” he asked, nearly 
trembling with rage. 

“They do everything willingly,” William said plainly. “The 
process only truly works if they freely release a portion of 
themselves.” The flames rose without warning, and heat 
radiated in painful waves from the gaping furnace. Carlton 
Shielded his eyes, and the creature on the table convulsed. 
William smiled. “Scared of fire. But they still trust me. They 
don’t see me as | am now; they only remember me as | was, 
you see.” 

Carlton broke his eyes away, feeling like he was waking 
from hypnosis. He darted his eyes desperately around the 
room, looking for something, anything, to attack with. The 
chamber was strewn with scrap metal and parts, and 
Carlton grabbed a metal pipe that lay by his feet and hefted 
it like a baseball bat. Afton was gazing down at the creature 
on the table, apparently insensible to anything else around 


him, and Carlton hesitated, considering the man for a 
moment. He looks like he could fall apart all on his own, he 
thought, taking in Afton’s fragile, hunched body and the thin 
Skin of his head, seeming to scarcely cover the skull 
beneath. Then he looked back to the creature on the table. / 
think I’ve got the moral high ground here, he decided 
grimly, and raised the pipe over his head as he stalked 
around the table toward Afton. 

Suddenly, his arms were jerked above his head, the pipe 
dropping from his hands and hitting the ground with a bang. 
Carlton struggled with the cables that gripped his wrists, but 
he could not wrestle free. Slowly, he was lifted off his feet, 
his arms stretched painfully out to his sides by two cables 
that extended from opposite sides of the room, seeming to 
attach to nothing. 

“I’ve never tried this on a human being before,” William 
muttered, pressing some kind of mechanical syringe into the 
chest of the molten creature on the table. He wrenched the 
tool sideways, extracting something with great difficulty. 
The syringe was opaque, and Carlton could not see what 
filled it, but his heart raced as he began to suspect he knew 
where this was going. He tugged harder at the cables that 
bound him, but each time he pulled, he only wrenched his 
shoulders from side to side. Afton pulled the syringe out of 
the creature and gave a Satisfied nod, then turned to 
Carlton. 

“Usually this goes into something mechanical; something 
| made. I’ve never attempted it on something ... sentient.” 
William gave Carlton a measured stare. “This will be an 
interesting experiment.” William lifted the mechanical 
syringe, carefully placing it over Carlton’s heart. Carlton 
gasped, but before he could try to move, William plunged 


the long needle into his chest. Carlton screamed, then 
realized distantly it was really the blond boy in the corner 
screaming: Carlton wheezed and gasped, but could make no 
sound as his chest burned with a blinding agony. Blood 
soaked his shirt, and it clung to his skin as he convulsed in 
his bonds. 

“For your sake, you’d better hope my little experiment 
does something; because | doubt you will survive 
otherwise,” William said mildly. He nodded toward the 
cables and Carlton dropped to the ground; the pain in his 
chest was unthinkable, he felt like he’d been hit full-on with 
a shotgun. Blood sputtered from his mouth, dripping onto 
the floor, and Carlton curled around himself, squeezing his 
eyes shut as the pain intensified. Please make it stop, he 
thought, then, Please don’t let me die. 

“Maybe the heart was too direct,” William lamented. 
“Well, that’s the point of this, to learn, trial and error.” He 
turned his gaze toward the blond-haired child, who still 
huddled weeping in the corner. 





Steps echoed endlessly in the dark, pacing back and forth 
across the enclosed space. 

“Are you still listening to me?” a voice rang out. 

Charlie was lost in the dark, spinning silently and trying 
to get to the surface of whatever void she was in. 

“Unlike you,” the other Charlie uttered, unseen, “I was 
real. | was an actual little girl, one who deserved the kind of 
attention showered over you. You were nothing.” 

Charlie opened her eyes, the room still spinning. She 
tried to breathe but all her breaths stopped short of going in 
or out. There was a doll laying on the floor a few feet in front 
of her. She reached for it convulsively, like gasping for air. 

“Do you want to know where my hate comes from? It’s 
not from this machine that | reside in, and it’s not from my 
past life, if that’s what you want to call it.” 


Charlie clawed at the floor with her fingers, unable to 
move the rest of her body. She gripped the doll with her 
fingertips and pulled it closer. 

“| hate because, even now, I’m still not enough,” 
Elizabeth whispered. She held out her sleek metallic fingers 
in front of her face. “Even after this; embodying the one 
thing Father did love, I’m not enough. Because he can’t 
duplicate this, he can’t make himself like me.” Her voice 
began to grow angry again. “He can’t duplicate what 
happened to me, or maybe he’s too scared to try it on 
himself. | broke free of my prison, | emerged from the flames 
and the wreckage of Henry’s last great failure, and | went to 
my father. | gave myself to him, to study, to use, to learn 
the secrets of my creation. And still it is you he wants.” 

Charlie clambered up onto her hands and knees and 
dragged herself toward the hallway. Elizabeth didn’t seem 
concerned, taking slow steps behind her, not trying to catch 
her, only to keep her in sight. 

“You, maybe he can re-create. Henry somehow got a 
piece of himself into you, and that’s something we haven't 
seen before. That’s ... unique.” 

Charlie kept crawling steadily: She was beginning to feel 
stronger, but she kept her movements slow and clumsy, 
getting as much distance as she could between herself and 
Elizabeth. Charlie looked up and down the hall, searching for 
something—anything—that might give her an advantage. 
The door to the next room was open, and she could see a 
desk: sitting on it was a round stone paperweight. Without 
picking up her pace, Charlie crawled across the room, 
dragging her legs as if they pained her, while Elizabeth’s 
Slow, patient steps followed a pace behind.

“Can you get the green for me?” a voice called. Carlton 
blinked. He was sitting upright but felt only half-present, as 
if he had been daydreaming. “The green,” the tiny voice 
repeated. “Please?” Carlton cast his eyes around for 
something green; the floor was black and white, and they 
were sitting somewhere a little dark. A little boy was 
hunched over a piece of paper, drawing. Carlton looked up. 
We’re under a table. Under the table at Freddy’s. There were 
drawings scattered in front of him on the floor, and a box of 
crayons spilled out across the tiles. Carlton spotted a green 
crayon that had rolled up against the wall, and he grabbed it 
and handed it to the little boy, who took it without looking 
up. 

“Michael,” Carlton said, recognition dawning. Michael 
continued to draw. “Where ... ?” Carlton looked around, but 
what he saw didn’t make sense to him. The pizzeria was 
brightly lit, yet Carlton couldn’t see more than five feet 
away, as though there was a blurry cloud masking 
everything beyond. He ducked his head out cautiously from 
under the table, but the bright lights hurt his eyes, and he 
Shielded them with his hand, crawling back under. Michael 
had not moved; he was drawing steadily, his brow furrowed 
in concentration. Carlton studied the pictures on the ground 
with a vague sense that something was wrong. / don’t 
belong here, he thought, yet part of him felt completely at 
home. 

“What are you doing?” he whispered to Michael, who 
looked up from his drawing at last. 

“| have to put them back together,” Michael explained. 
“See?” He pointed out from the table, at the pizzeria around 


them. Carlton squinted into the blurry horizon, seeing 
nothing at first, then they began to appear: he saw pages 
and pages of colorful drawings, some on the walls, others 
blowing through the air. “They’re all in pieces,” Michael said. 
He shuffled the pages in front of him and found two that 
showed the same child, then he placed one on top of the 
other, and began to trace the lines. “These go together,” 
Michael said, holding up the picture: the two drawings had 
become one, the separate pages somehow bonded 
together; the lines were clearer and the colors more vibrant. 

“What are you putting back together?” Carlton asked. 

“My friends.” Michael pointed to a single picture propped 
up against the wall. It showed five children: three boys and 
two girls, standing together in a cheerful pose, with a yellow 
rabbit standing behind them. 

“| know this picture,” Carlton said slowly. His mind was 
still foggy, and as he tried to grasp at the answer, it only 
Slipped further away. “Who is that?” Carlton whispered, 
pointing to the rabbit. 

“He’s our friend.” Michael smiled, not looking up from his 
work. “Can you go get more for me?” Carlton looked out into 
the pizzeria: the space he could see had expanded a little 
more, and now he could make out the blurs of other children 
who seemed to be grasping at pages as they flew by, trying 
to grab the drawings. Carlton got out from under the table 
and stood up, walking through the midst of the mirage and 
colors. A boy in a black-and-white-striped shirt came 
running up, chasing a piece of paper. 

“What are you doing?” Carlton asked as the boy grabbed 
empty air, and the page flew away into the blurry distance. 

“My papers blew away,” the boy cried, and hurried off. 
Carlton turned and saw another boy in the same outfit on 


the opposite side of the room, chasing other pages. A little 
girl with long blonde hair ran past him, and he whirled 
around, recognizing her far away: there were duplicates of 
each child, all of them chasing different pages. 

A single figure stood still amongst the chaos, out of 
phase with the surroundings. At first it seemed to be a man 
bent over a table, but as Carlton’s head throbbed with 
waves of confusion, the man became a yellow rabbit, not 
standing over a table, but over five children, tied together 
as one. The second image washed away, and the rabbit 
became a man again, standing in the dark. The children ran 
past the man as if they could not see him; as Carlton 
watched, several children ran straight through him without 
seeming to notice. Carlton approached the man, and as he 
got closer, the yellow rabbit appeared again, turning to look 
at him momentarily before blowing away like smoke, leaving 
the man underneath. 

“This isn’t real,” Carlton gasped, trying to parse the two 
overlapping realities that seemed to be swirling around him. 
Three figures seemed to hold fast, while the rest of his 
Surroundings flickered in and out of existence: the man 
standing at the table, a blond boy in the corner—the only 
child not running, and not repeated—and a body lying on 
the floor, curled in a puddle of blood. /s that me? Am | dead? 

“No, silly!” a child called. “You’re with us!” 

The syringe mechanism recoiled with a loud snap: the 
man in shadow had taken something from the metal body 
on the table. Suddenly, another drawing flew into the air, 
and another ghostly child appeared to chase it. 

The little girl with blonde locks of hair and a red ribbon 
bouncing on her shoulders ran past as well. 


“Stop!” Carlton called, and she obeyed, her eyes still 
locked on the drawings she had been pursuing. “Who is 
that?” Carlton directed her attention to the yellow rabbit 
flickering in and out of existence. 

“That’s our friend. He helped me find my puppy!” she 
exclaimed before running off again. 

“They don’t know,” Carlton whispered, releasing her as 
she disappeared into the blur surrounding him. Carlton 
searched the air as drawings blew by, snatching at the ones 
with images that seemed familiar. 

“What are you doing?” the little boy in the striped shirt 
asked. 

“I’m going to help you put these together,” Carlton said,

When she had finally crawled her way to the desk, Charlie 
reached up and grabbed for the top of it, then pulled herself 
up, feigning a struggle. She winced as she put weight on her 
feet, continuing to act weaker than she actually was: in 
reality she was nearly back to her full strength. She leaned 
heavily on the desk as if for support, putting one hand 
directly on the heavy stone paperweight. 

“We both know he won't be able to re-create you, either.” 
Elizabeth was near. “And the real question would be, would 
we really want him to? Besides ...” Elizabeth approached 
Charlie from behind, moving faster. “I think | hate you more 
than | love him.” She raised her hand in attack and Charlie 
spun around, swinging the rock in a single motion. There 
was a thunderous crack as it slammed into Elizabeth’s face, 


and Charlie fell back with the shock, dropping the 
paperweight. She hit the ground hard, cradling her hand. 

Elizabeth staggered backward, holding her hand over her 
face, but she could not conceal the damage without her 
illusion. One entire side of her gleaming white jaw had been 
knocked off her face, revealing the wires beneath. She 
cocked her head to the side for a moment, as if running a 
system check; Charlie didn’t wait for the result. She leaped 
to her feet, pushing past Elizabeth as she ran back the way 
she’d come. Charlie heard Elizabeth moving, and dove for 
the hall closet, pulling it shut tight behind her. 

“| know it may sound very childish of me,” Elizabeth 
cried; her voice sounded like she was still at the end of the 
hall. “But if he doesn’t want me; then he won’t get you, 
either.” 

The footsteps drew closer, and Charlie looked one way 
and another, hoping desperately for a place to hide in the 
Small closet. Then suddenly, as she turned completely 
around, she saw a familiar thing. You. The faceless robot 
wielding its knife, the mannequin, the construct that her 
father had built for one purpose, to end his life. 

“Your dad thought you were so special, your memory was 
just too precious to let go of.” 

The blank face was almost peaceful in the dark. It had 
been built for one thing; it had completed its duty, and had 
remained in silence ever since, standing as a memorial to 
pain, and to loss. 

The closet door moved slightly as Elizabeth gripped the 
knob; Charlie could see her shadow under the door. She 
grabbed at the clothing hanging behind her, old coats and 
dresses, and pulled them forward, concealing the construct 
as best she could. “You can’t overpower me,” Elizabeth 


whispered. “You aren’t like me,” she added with relish. 
Charlie waited in front of the blank-faced creature, not 
hiding. Gently, Elizabeth pulled the door open. 

“| shouldn’t be here,” Charlie whispered to Elizabeth. 

Charlie heard John cough from the room behind them, 
and relief rushed through her. He’s going to be okay. He’s 
alive. Elizabeth glanced back as though considering him, 
then trained her eyes on Charlie and took two deliberate 
steps forward. 

“Charlie!” John called from outside. 

“It’s okay, John,” Elizabeth answered, her voice 
indistinguishable from Charlie’s. “I’ll be right out.” 
Instantaneously, she looked like Charlie again, not the 
grown-up Charlie she had been masquerading as, but 
Charlie as she was really, a mirror reflection. She shifted 
awkwardly, her eyes darting back toward John for just a 
moment, then gave Charlie a cruel smile. “How far do you 
think | could get with him before he noticed?” she 
whispered. 

“You're right, Elizabeth,” Charlie said. Elizabeth’s smile 
faded. “I was never supposed to be here.” 

“No?” Elizabeth took the last step, closing the distance 
between them. She gripped Charlie by the neck, pressing up 
against her. 

“Neither of us were.” Charlie gripped the rag doll close to 
her chest. Elizabeth frowned in confusion, then peered over 
Charlie’s shoulder, seeing the robot standing directly behind 
her. Charlie flinched her other hand, which was behind her 
back, doing something unseen with a quick motion. A metal 
pulley screamed. 

Charlie closed her eyes, hugging the doll, and when the 
knife went through them, it did not hurt. 


Elizabeth gasped as the blade plunged through her, too, 
sounding almost human. Charlie saw Elizabeth’s face, rigid 
with shock, then it was gone, replaced by the smooth metal 
plates of her robotic form. Sparks burst in the air above her 
as Charlie’s vision began to fade, and the smell of hot 
plastic came to her from very far away. 

“It’s not fair.” Elizabeth’s voice sputtered with static. “1 
never had a life.” 

Charlie struggled to take in a breath, still clutching the 
rag doll to her chest. She reached for Elizabeth’s dangling 
hand clumsily and caught it; Elizabeth looked at her 
confusedly, and Charlie strained to pull her hand up to the 
rag doll. Fumbling, she closed Elizabeth’s fingers around the 
doll, then, still holding her hand, Charlie pushed with the 
last of her strength, sliding the doll across the four-inch 
stretch of blade between them until it rested against 
Elizabeth’s chest. Charlie tried to smile, but everything was 
dark; she had forgotten how to see. Charlie felt her head fall 
forward, and could not pull it up again. Elizabeth twitched 
for a moment longer, rattling the blade that pierced them 
both, then her head slumped forward, too, resting against 
Charlie’s forehead. 

Charlie! John was screaming her name. CHARLIE! 

| love you, too. The words didn’t come, and then there 
was nothing at all.

“Here, right here!” Carlton called. The little boy in the 
Striped shirt helped align two more pictures, and Michael 
traced over them, connecting them into a single drawing. A 
second boy in a striped shirt appeared from the blurry 


Surroundings and sat down on top of the one already sitting 
with them, merging into him seamlessly. Only Carlton 
seemed to notice the merging of the two children, not even 
the boy in the striped shirt himself seemed aware. 

Beside them was the little girl with blonde curls: they had 
found all her drawings and put them together, and now she 
looked solid and real, no longer ghostly like the others. She 
was able to speak in full sentences, her cognitive abilities 
having steadily grown stronger as her drawings were united. 
Carlton struggled to find matching images for the others: he 
was keeping track of the three stable figures, the man, the 
boy in the corner, and the body, and it was clear he was 
running out of time. The man was making preparations to 
harm the boy in the corner. 

“You said he saved your dog?” Carlton asked the blonde 
girl, grasping for answers. 

“Mommy said that he went to heaven, but | heard Daddy 
say he was hit by a car. But | knew it wasn’t true, Bonnie 
told me it wasn’t true; he said that he had found my puppy.” 
She brushed a lock of hair from her shoulder with her hand. 

“And did he take you to your puppy?” 

“He took me, but | don’t remember ...” 

“But it was him who helped you?” Carlton pointed to the 
yellow bunny in the drawing that showed all five kids. 

“Yes! That’s him.” She smiled. “My name is Susie,” she 
added. “And that’s Cassidy.” A girl with long black hair 
approached, carrying more pictures in her arms. “And you?” 

Carlton looked briefly at a little boy with freckles. “I...” 
He struggled to speak, and Carlton glanced nervously at the 
man in the room as he matched two more drawings 
together. 


“There!” Michael exclaimed proudly. Another ghostly 
image of the freckled boy climbed under the table, and 
merged with the one who was already there: he instantly 
became less ghostly, and more whole. “I’m Fritz.” He 
smiled, suddenly filled with more life.

William Afton clenched his fists, studying his own hands for 
a moment then looking toward the medical monitors in the 
corner. “I feel that my time is running short.” He looked 
toward Carlton thoughtfully, but Carlton was still lying on 
the floor, motionless. “That’s unfortunate,” he growled. “1 
hoped to learn something. But maybe that’s not the 
problem.” He looked toward the metal table. “Maybe we just 
need some new life in this mass of metal.” He smiled at the 
little blond boy, who recoiled and tried to scoot away, 
though he was already as close to the wall as he could get. 
“You'll have to forgive me, though, as I’m not sure how to do 
that, either.” William took steps toward him. “I can think of a 
few things to try. At the very least, it will be fun; like old 
times.” His lips peeled back, revealing two full rows of 
stained yellow teeth. 

The door creaked as it opened, and William’s eyes darted 
toward it as a tangled metal mess lurched toward him, 
scraping across the floor. “What are you doing back here?” 
William asked. The white painted fox head was turned at an 
alarming angle, clearly not functioning properly. Its limbs 
were all turned and pivoted, some of them broken and 
dragging, all inching the remains of the creature into the 
room. The fox head’s eye spun wildly, searching the ceiling. 
William pointed to a corner. “You’re no use to me anymore; 


get out of the way,” he said dismissively, then drew back, 
surprised: following the fox was another motorcade of 
broken parts, their wires reaching for one another like vines, 
pulling each other along and holding themselves together. 
Mounted on the back of the entanglement was the white- 
and-purple face of a bear. “/’m heeeere!” a voice came from 
a speaker somewhere within the mess, cracking and 
popping with static. 

William made a face, unnerved by the wrecked, 
comingled creatures. “Get back,” he uttered, giving the 
Freddy face a kick. The mass of parts slid away without 
resistance, sounding almost disappointed as they came to a 
stop a few feet away. “What a waste,” he hissed. He turned 
his attention to the fox again, apparently the most intact. 
“Bring that boy to me,” he instructed, and the fox turned its 
eye to the corner. 


“| have to go do something for him,” Susie said cheerfully, 
getting to her feet. 

“Something for who?” Carlton asked with alarm, and took 
hold of her arm. 

“Bonnie.” She smiled, gesturing toward the cheerful 
yellow rabbit wavering in and out of existence beside the 
table. “He asked me to do something for him just now. He 
wants to bring a new friend for us and he needs my help.” 

“Bonnie isn’t your friend,” Carlton said, still holding her 
arm. He gasped at the imminent danger that the little blond 
boy faced, as the girl struggled to break away. 

“He is my friend! He found my puppy!” she cried, and 
yanked her arm free. 


“No, don’t go to him!” Carlton pleaded.

John. 

“Get back!” John screamed and jolted awake, swinging 
his arms up to block an attack and jerking back. His head 
cracked against the cabinet behind him. “Ow.” He groaned, 
regaining awareness of where he was. He rolled over, 
holding his side gingerly, then held perfectly still, tilting his 
head to listen. Silence reverberated through the space, 
weighing down the room with emptiness. “Charlie,” he 
whispered, everything that had happened rushing back all 
at once. The hallway. John pulled himself to his feet with a 
sick dread, bracing himself against the cabinet door. His 
right foot gave way as soon as he put weight on it, pain 
shooting up through his ankle, and he put a hand against 
the wall for balance, then hopped on his left foot to reach 
the door. 

He crashed hard against the doorframe, wincing as his 
ribs flared with pain, then squinted, trying to see in the 
dark. “Charlie!” he called. The closet door was open, and he 
could see figures inside, but he couldn’t make out anything 
distinct. He made his way to the closet, leaning on the wall 
and trying to ignore his throbbing ankle. It was difficult to 
see through the hanging coats; and he began to shove them 
aside, then stopped abruptly, scarcely avoiding the blade of 
a massive knife—almost a sword—pointed directly at him. 
He blinked as his eyes adjusted: the blade was connected to 
an extended metal arm—the figure he had first thought was 
holding the knife had instead been run through with it, and 
behind that was something else—something familiar. He 


backed away, bending to look at the inhuman face of the 
creature impaled on the knife. 

He stared for a moment, his face growing hot, then 
suddenly he turned away and doubled over, overcome with 
a wave of nausea. He dropped to his knees and retched, his 
ribs screaming protest as he heaved, but there was nothing 
in his stomach to throw up. He gasped, trying make it stop, 
but his stomach clenched and spasmed until he felt like he 
would be turned inside out. 

When at last it began to abate, John rested his forehead 
against the wall, his eyes watering. Light-headed, he got to 
his feet, feeling as if years had passed. He did not look into 
the closet again. 

John limped toward the door, grinding his teeth with 
every step, but he did not stop moving until he was outside 
the house, and he did not look back.

“There!” Michael cheered, momentarily distracting Susie 
from trying to leave. The last phantom of the girl with long 
black hair came and sat with them. When she had merged 
with the others like her, she blinked, then looked up and 
took in a long, calm breath. “We’re all together now,” 
Michael said with a smile. The drawings on the ground had 
disappeared, and five real-seeming children sat with Carlton 
under the table, no longer ghostly images. 

“The rabbit isn’t your friend,” Carlton repeated. Susie 
gave him a puzzled look, and pointed to the only drawing 
left, the large one that showed all five children with the 
smiling yellow rabbit. 


“| said bring him to the table,” William said angrily, 
drawing Carlton’s attention across the shadows. The painted 
fox cocked its head to the side, but before William could 
scold it again, more noises came from the hall. The door 
opened, pushed like something was bumping against it, and 
a variety of mechanical things made their way into the 
room, crawling and clawing their way across the floor in 
various states of disrepair. There were the climbing babies, 
and the gangly clown that had sat atop a carnival game in 
the dining room; others filed in that Carlton did not 
recognize: waddling dolls painted with clowns’ faces, 
disjointed circus animals, and other things he could not 
even name. 

“Get back,” William hissed at the macabre processional, 
and brushed a crawler aside with his foot, struggling to keep 
his balance. The little blond boy had stopped crying; he was 
staring stunned at the creatures, shrinking away with his 
hand half blocking his face. 

“Afraid of them, now?” William turned on the boy. “Don’t 
fear them. Fear me,” he snarled with renewed strength, and 
he clenched his jaw, taking stiff but deliberate steps toward 
the boy. “I’m the only thing in this room that you should be 
afraid of,” he said, and the boy turned to him again, his face 
still full of fear. “I’m just as dangerous as I’ve always been,” 
William growled. He grabbed the boy by the arm and 
dragged him to the table. 

“No, no, no!” Carlton shouted as he watched the 
shadowy figure hoist the boy onto the table. He glanced 
helplessly at the children, but they looked at him blankly. 
“Can’t you see? He’s hurting that boy!” The children just 
shook their heads confusedly. “He’s in danger, | have to help 


him. Let me out.” Carlton struggled to get up, but his legs 
were weighted down, and anchored to the illusion. 

“That’s just Bonnie.” Susie smiled. 

“Bonnie is not your friend! He’s the one that hurt you, 
don’t you remember?” Carlton cried with mounting 
frustration. He grabbed the final drawing from the wall, the 
one with the five children standing with the yellow rabbit, 
and laid it flat on the floor, then took up a red crayon. He 
bent over the drawing and began to make thick marks on it, 
pressing the crayon deep into the paper. The children 
strained closer to see what he was drawing. 

“Here we go,” William Afton said from the shadows. 
Carlton glanced up to see the little boy squirming on top of 
the mass of metal, where William was holding him in place. 
The table was heating up, the orange glow beginning to 
flare from within it. “I’m running out of ideas,” William said, 
failing to hide his anxiety. “But if I’m not going to survive 
this, then you certainly aren’t, either.” William pressed down 
on the boy’s chest, and the boy struggled to free himself. 

“Ouch!” the boy cried as his elbow touched the table 
below, where the orange glow was spreading. He jerked his 
arm up and cradled it, sobbing, then shrieked as his foot 
pressed onto the table and began to hiss. He yanked it back, 
howling. 

“We will see where this takes us,” William said. 

“Look!” Carlton yelled, tapping the drawing hard with his 
crayon. The children huddled close. The yellow rabbit’s eyes 
were now dark red, and blood dripped from its mouth. The 
children looked confusedly at Carlton, but there was a spark 
of recognition in their faces. “I’m sorry,” Carlton said 
desperately. “This—is the bad man. This. This is the bad 
man.” Carlton pointed from the drawing to William Afton and 


back again. “He is the bad man who hurt you, and right now 
he’s about to hurt someone else,” Carlton pleaded.

A hand gripped William’s pant leg, and he shook it off. “Get 
away from me,” he growled, but the hand persisted. The 
tangle of parts connected to the purple Freddy head was 
gathering around William’s ankles, pieces plucking at him. “1 
said get off me!” he said again. His legs shook beneath him, 
and he let go of the boy, teetering as he struggled to regain 
his balance. He grasped for something steady, and his 
hands instinctively found the table. He recoiled, gasping in 
pain, and fell backward onto the floor, watching helplessly 
as the little blond boy rolled off the table and ran to the 
back wall. 

Afton struggled to right himself as the wires and 
mechanisms scattered about the room all marched toward 
him to collect into a central mass, crawling up onto his body 
and threatening to engulf him. He pulled the pieces off and 
threw them aside to break apart on the concrete floor of the 
basement, then got unsteadily to his feet. William set his 
eyes on the boy once more: nothing else mattered. He took 
three laborious steps forward, machines still wrapped 
around his legs. The head of the white fox snapped at him 
from his ankle, where it had wound its limbs around his leg, 
and the purple bear had sunk its jaw into his calf, and was 
biting down. One of the crawling babies had climbed up 
onto William’s back, where it thrashed its weight back and 
forth, setting his frail body swaying. Another crawler held 
fast to his ankle, chewing at his flesh. Blood dripped onto 
the floor with each step he took, but William’s eyes 


remained fixed on the terrified boy, his fury only growing. 
Finally, in a burst of anger he flung the robotic baby from his 
back and stomped down on the metal bear’s head, breaking 
its jaw and dislodging its teeth from his leg. 

At last, William reached the child. The blond boy 
screamed as William brushed his bony fingers over the 
boy’s face, then suddenly William felt something blazing hot 
wrap around his waist, and yank him back. He twisted wildly 
and saw: the creature from the table was standing, and its 
two melted metal arms were now gripping William from 
behind, pulling him away from the boy. Its skin contorted 
and moved like molten metal, its motions jerky and 
unnatural. Its joints popped and snapped as it moved, as 
though each movement should have been impossible. 

“No!” William cried, hearing the crackle of flame as his 
hospital gown caught fire, pressed against the burning 
creature. 

Carlton opened his eyes and took a breath, a rea/ one; he 
clutched his chest and tried to remain motionless, lifting 
only his eyes to watch as the amalgamation of metal and 
cords pulled William Afton backward into the massive 
furnace. Smoke and fire erupted from the thing with a roar, 
and then the room was still. The creatures and parts that 
had been wriggling on the floor stopped at once, and did not 
move again. 

Carlton felt the searing pain in his chest surge, and he 
Slipped into darkness. 

Carlton. Carlton opened his eyes; Michael was sitting 
patiently beside him, apparently waiting for him to wake up. 

“Is he okay now?” Michael gave Carlton an anxious smile. 
Carlton looked up to see four small figures disappearing into 


a flood of light. Only Michael remained under the table. “Is 
he okay?” Michael repeated, waiting for confirmation. 

“Yeah,” Carlton whispered. “He’s okay. Go be with your 
friends.” He smiled, but Michael didn’t get up. He was 
looking at Carlton’s chest, where someone had placed a 
drawing over his wound. “This is a part of you,” Carlton said, 
grasping at the picture. 

“You'll die without it,” Michael whispered. 

“| can’t keep this.” Carlton shook his head as Michael 
pushed it back. “You can give it to me next time you see 
me.” 

Michael smiled, and the drawing began to fade, hovering 
where Michael had placed it for a last moment before the 
ghostly image vanished, seeming to sink into Carlton’s 
chest. 

Thank you. Carlton heard the echo of Michael’s voice, but 
Michael was gone, and there was nothing but the light.

“Carlton!” john. 
“Carlton, hang on!” 
“We're going to get you out of here!” 
Marla. Jessica. 
“Carlton!” 





So, what happened then?” Marla had scooted so close to 
Carlton’s hospital bed that she was practically in the bed 
with him. 

“Ouch, Marla! The nurse said | need to sleep, and | 
shouldn’t be exposed to a lot of stress right now.” He 
reached for a juice box nearby, but Marla pushed it out of 
reach. 

“Oh please, | practically am a nurse, and besides, | want 
to know what happened.” Marla lifted a series of tubes and 
pulled them out of her way so she could get closer. 

“Marla! Those are attached to me! Those are keeping me 
alive!” He searched frantically around his bedside table. 
“Where’s my panic button?” 

Marla felt around the edges of the bed until she found 
the small device with a red button on it, then set it neatly in 


her lap, clearly under her protection. “No juice; no nurse; 
tell me what happened.” 

“Where’s Dad—Clay?” He lifted his eyes, searching the 
room until he found his father, who was standing by the 
window, his face tight with worry. 

“I’m right here,” he said, and shook his head. “You gave 
uS a SCare, and it wasn’t a practical joke this time.” 

Carlton grinned, but it was short-lived as he glanced 
around the small room in distress. 

“Are the kids all right?” he asked, not sure he wanted to 
hear the answer. 

“They're safe. All of them,” Jessica said quickly. 

“All of them?” Carlton said in joyful disbelief. 

“Yes. You saved him, the last one.” Jessica smiled. 

“And he’s okay?” Carlton said again for confirmation, and 
Jessica nodded. 

“And Charlie?” he said softly. Jessica and Marla looked at 
each other, unsure. 

“We don’t know,” Clay said, stepping forward. “I’ve been 
out to look for her, and I’m going to keep looking for her, but 
So far ...” He broke off, then cleared his throat. “I’m going to 
keep looking,” he repeated. 

Carlton looked down thoughtfully, then looked up once 
more. “And what about hot Charlie?” 

Marla slapped Carlton’s shoulder and he recoiled. “Marla! 
Ouch! | almost died; this is blood on my bed!” 

“That’s Kool-Aid. You spilled it all over yourself about an 
hour ago.” Marla rolled her eyes. 

“John?” Carlton suddenly spotted him in the doorway, 
hanging back so far he was almost in the hall. John waved, 
smiling slightly. 


“Looks like they have you patched up pretty good,” he 
said, nodding toward Carlton’s bandages. 

“Yeah.” Something’s wrong. Carlton considered John for a 
moment, but before he could formulate a question, a nurse 
stepped briskly into the room. 

“Visiting time’s over for now,” she said apologetically. 
“We need to run some tests.” 

Clay stepped up to the bed, displacing Marla briefly. “Get 
some rest, huh?” he said, and patted the top of Carlton’s 
head. 

“Dad,” he groaned. “I’m not five.” Clay smiled and 
headed for the door; John stopped him. 

“You're going to keep looking for Charlie?” he asked. 

“Of course,” Clay said reassuringly, but gave him a 
confused look before leaving the room. 

“You're not going to find her,” John said softly. The rest of 
them watched, discomfited, as John slipped out the door 
without another word, not waiting for anyone else. 

“Hey, we found this next to you. | wasn’t sure if it was 
important,” Jessica said, pulling Carlton’s attention back, 
and handed him a folded piece of paper, heavy with crayon 
marks within. He unfolded it, revealing a grassy hill with five 
children running over it, the sun overhead. 

“Yours?” Jessica asked. 

“Yeah.” Carlton smiled. “Mine.” 

“Okay.” Jessica gave him a suspicious look, then returned 
the smile, leaving the room. Carlton held the drawing close 
and gazed out the window. 


He had come into the room cautiously, afraid to wake her 
up. The room was dark except for the light filtering in 
through the small dirty window, and she peered at him for a 
moment as if she could not see him. 

“john?” she whispered at last. 

“Yeah, did | wake you up?” 

She was so quiet for a time that he thought she was 
asleep, then she murmured, “You said you loved me.” 

The memory turned bitter here, and it had been nagging 
at him ever since—since everything ended. You said you 
loved me, she said, and he had babbled nonsense in 
response. 

He stood in the gravel parking lot for a moment, feeling 
woefully unprepared. He tapped his hand nervously on the 
metal fence post, then took a deep breath and went through 
the gate. Slowly, he followed the path he had once watched 
Charlie take, hindered a little by the brace on his ankle. 
Most of the cemetery was as green and well kept as any 
park, but this corner was all scrubby grass and dirt. Two 
small, plain tombstones sat together just beside the fence, a 
telephone pole rising behind them like a sheltering tree. 

John took a step toward them, then stopped with the 
sudden feeling that he was being watched. He turned ina 
Slow circle, and then he saw her. She was standing beneath 
a tree just a few yards away, where the grass grew lush and 
green. 

She smiled, and extended a hand, beckoning him to her. 
He stood where he was. For a moment the world seemed 
blunted, his mind had gone numb. He could feel that his 
face had no expression, but he could not remember how to 
move it. He looked back at the stones with a sharp stab of 
longing, then swallowed and took steady breaths until he 


could move again. He turned to the woman under the tree, 
her arm still extended, and went to her.
